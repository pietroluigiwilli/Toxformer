0.0,2.0,T3D0001,Arsenic,"Arsenic(As) is a ubiquitous metalloid found in several forms in food and the environment, such as the soil, air and water. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. The predominant form is inorganic arsenic in drinking water, which is both highly toxic and carcinogenic and rapidly bioavailable. Arsenic is currently one of the most important environmental global contaminants and toxicants, particularly in the developing countries. For decades, very large populations have been and are currently still exposed to inorganic Arsenic through geogenically contaminated drinking water. An increased incidence of disease mediated by this toxicant is the consequence of long-term exposure. In human's chronic ingestion of inorganic arsenic (> 500 mg/L As) has been associated with cardiovascular, nervous, hepatic and renal diseases and diabetes mellitus as well as cancer of the skin, bladder, lung, liver and prostate. Contrary to the earlier view that methylated compounds are innocuous, the methylated metabolites are now recognized to be both toxic and carcinogenic, possibly due to genotoxicity, inhibition of antioxidative enzyme functions, or other mechanisms. Arsenic inhibits indirectly sulfhydryl containing enzymes and interferes with cellular metabolism. Effects involve such phenomena as cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and inhibition of enzymes with antioxidant function. These are all related to nutritional factors directly or indirectly. Nutritional studies both in experimental and epidemiological studies provide convincing evidence that nutritional intervention, including chemoprevention, offers a pragmatic approach to mitigate the health effects of arsenic exposure, particularly cancer, in the relatively resource-poor developing countries. Nutritional intervention, especially with micronutrients, many of which are antioxidants and share the same pathway with Arsenic , appears a host defence against the health effects of arsenic contamination in developing countries and should be embraced as it is pragmatic and inexpensive. (A7664, A7665).",7440-38-2,104734.0,As,74.9216,Grey metallic solid.,> 615°C,614 °C ,,Oral (L2); inhalation (L2); dermal (L2),"Arsenic and its metabolites disrupt ATP production through several mechanisms. At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and by competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Arsenic's carcinogenicity is influenced by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. The binding of other arsenic protein targets may also cause altered DNA repair enzyme activity, altered DNA methylation patterns and cell proliferation. (T1, A17)","Arsenic is absorbed mainly by inhalation or ingestion, as to a lesser extent, dermal exposure. It is then distributed throughout the body, where it is reduced into arsenite if necessary, then methylated into monomethylarsenic (MMA) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) by arsenite methyltransferase. Arsenic and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Arsenic is known to induce the metal-binding protein metallothionein, which decreases the toxic effects of arsenic and other metals by binding them and making them biologically inactive, as well as acting as an antioxidant.

The World Health Organization asserts that a level of 0.01 mg/L in drinking water poses a risk of 1/1600 chance of lifetime skin cancer risk.","Arsenic poisoning can lead to death from multi-system organ failure, probably from necrotic cell death, not apoptosis. Arsenic is also a known carcinogen, especially in skin, liver, bladder and lung cancers. (T1, L20) Arsenic poisoning is has also been associated with heart disease, (hypertension related cardiovascular), stroke (cerebrovascular diseases), chronic lower respiratory diseases and diabetes. Chronic exposure to arsenic can lead to a vitamin A deficiency which is related to heart disease and night blindness.","Exposure to lower levels of arsenic can cause nausea and vomiting, decreased production of red and white blood cells, abnormal heart rhythm, damage to blood vessels, and a sensation of “pins and needles” in hands and feet. Breathing high levels of inorganic arsenic can give you a sore throat or irritated lungs. Arsenic also affects the brain, causing neurological disturbances such as headaches, confusion, and drowsiness. (A1)","Arsenic poisoning can be treated by chelation therapy, using chelating agents such as dimercaprol, EDTA or DMSA. Charcoal tablets may also be used for less severe cases. In addition, maintaining a diet high in sulfur helps eliminate arsenic from the body.

5.0,8.0,T3D0007,Cadmium,"Cadmium (group IIB of the periodic table of elements) is a heavy metal. It is not a naturally occurring metal in biological systems. Cadmium poses severe risks to human health. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Up to this day, it has not been shown that cadmium has any physiological function within the human body. Interest has therefore risen in its biohazardous potential. As first described by Friedrich Stromeyer (Gottingen, Germany) in 1817, cadmium intoxication can lead to kidney, bone, and pulmonary damage. Cadmium is widely used in industrial processes, e.g as an anticorrosive agent, as a stabilizer in PVC products, as a colour pigment, a neutron absorber in nuclear power plants, and in the fabrication of nickel cadmium batteries. Phosphate fertilizers also show a big cadmium load. Although some cadmium containing products can be recycled, a large share of the general cadmium pollution is caused by dumping and incinerating cadmium polluted waste. In Scandinavia for example, cadmium concentration in agricultural soil increases by 0.2 percent per year. Total global emission of cadmium amounts to 7000 t/year. The maximum permissible value for workers according to German law is 15 ug/l. For comparison: Non-smokers show an average cadmium blood concentration of 0.5 ug/l. Basically there are three possible ways of cadmium resorption: Gastrointestinal, pulmonary and dermal. The uptake through the human gastrointestinal is approximately 5 percent of an ingested amount of cadmium, depending on the exact dose and nutritional composition. The major source of inhalative cadmium intoxication is cigarette smoke. The human lung resorbes 40 to 60 percent of the cadmium in tobacco smoke. Little research has been done on dermal absorption of cadmium. Two mechanisms facilitate cadmium absorption by the skin: binding of a free cadmium ion to sulfhydryl radicals of cysteine in epidermal keratins, or an induction and complexing with metallothionein. Once taken up by the blood, the majority of cadmium is transported bound to proteins, such as Albumin and Metallothionein. The first organ reached after cadmium uptake into the GI-blood is the liver. Here cadmium induces the production of Metallothionein. After consecutive hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, Cd-Metallothionein complexes are washed into sinusoidal blood. From here, parts of the absorbed cadmium enter the entero-hepatical cycle via secretion into the biliary tract in form of Cadmium-glutathione conjugates. Enzymatically degraded to cadmium-cysteine complexes in the biliary tree, cadmium reenters the small intestines. The main organ for long-term cadmium accumulation is the kidney. Here the half life period for cadmium is approximately 10 years. A life long intake can therefore lead to a cadmium accumulation in the kidney, consequently resulting in tubulus cell necrosis. The blood concentration of cadmium serves as a reliable indicator for a recent exposition, while the urinary concentration reflects past exposure, body burden and renal accumulation. Excretion of Cadmium takes place via faeces and urine. (A7670).",7440-43-9,31193.0,Cd,113.903358,Bluish-white metallic solid.,321°C,"1040 K

Accumulation of cadmium in the kidney results in increased excretion of vital low and high molecular weight proteins. Cadmium is a high affinity zinc analog and can interfere in its biological processes. It also binds to and activates the estrogen receptor, likely stimulating the growth of certain types of cancer cells and causing other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. Cadmium causes cell apoptosis by activating mitogen-activated protein kinases. (L8, A18, A19, A28)","Cadmium is absorbed from oral, inhalation, and dermal routes.

Indirect food additive arising from adhesives and polymers Chloroform is a common solvent in the laboratory because it is relatively unreactive, miscible with most organic liquids, and conveniently volatile. Chloroform is used as a solvent in the pharmaceutical industry and for producing dyes and pesticides. Chloroform is an effective solvent for alkaloids in their base form and thus plant material is commonly extracted with chloroform for pharmaceutical processing. For example, it is commercially used to extract morphine from poppies and scopolamine from Datura plants. Chloroform containing deuterium (heavy hydrogen), CDCl3, is a common solvent used in NMR spectroscopy. It can be used to bond pieces of acrylic glass (also known under the trade names Perspex and Plexiglas). Chloroform is a solvent of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1 is used to dissolve non-nucleic acid biomolecules in DNA and RNA extractions. Chloroform is the organic compound with formula CHCl3. It does not undergo combustion in air, although it will burn when mixed with more flammable substances. It is a member of a group of compounds known as trihalomethanes. Chloroform has myriad uses as a reagent and a solvent. It is also considered an environmental hazard. Several million tons are produced annually. The output of this process is a mixture of the four chloromethanes: chloromethane, dichloromethane, chloroform (trichloromethane), and carbon tetrachloride, which are then separated by distillation.Chloroform has been shown to exhibit antifoaming agent, anti-coagulant, depressant, analgesic and anti-fungal functions (A7671, A7672, A7673, A7674, A7675).Chloroform belongs to the family of Organochlorides.

DDT reduces potassium transport across the membrane. DDT inhibits the inactivation of voltaged-gated sodium channels. The channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization and resulting in a state of hyperexcitability. DDT inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. DDT also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron. DDT is also believed to adversely affect the reproductive system by mimicking endogenous hormones and binding to the estrogen and adrogen receptors.

PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

11.0,15.0,T3D0014,Aroclor 1260,"Aroclor 1260 is a commercial mixture of PCBs with an average chlorine content of 60%. It is composed of mainly pentachlorobiphenyls (43.35%) and hexachlorobuphenyls (38.54%) and also includes mono-, bi-, tri, tetra-, hexa-, octa- and nonachlorinated homologs. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of 209 synthetic organic compounds with 1-10 chlorine atoms attached to biphenyl. PCBs were manufactured as commercial mixtures but banned in the 1970's because they were found to bioaccumulate in the environment and cause harmful health effects. However, PCBs do not break down readily and are still found in the environment.

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are trasported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin. Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The major metabolites are hydroxylated products which are excreted in the bile and faeces. The slow metabolism of PCBs means they tend to accumulate in body tissues.

13.0,17.0,T3D0016,Trichloroethylene,"Trichloroethylene is a solvent and extractive in the manufacture of foods. One recent review of the epidemiology of kidney cancer rated cigarette smoking and obesity as more important risk factors for kidney cancer than exposure to solvents such as trichloroethylene. In contrast, the most recent overall assessment of human health risks associated with trichloroethylene states, [t]here is concordance between animal and human studies, which supports the conclusion that trichloroethylene is a potential kidney carcinogen. The evidence appears to be less certain at this time regarding the relationship between humans and liver cancer observed in mice, with the NAS suggesting that low-level exposure might not represent a significant liver cancer risk in the general population. The chemical compound trichloroethylene is a chlorinated hydrocarbon commonly used as an industrial solvent. It is a clear non-flammable liquid with a sweet smell. The first known report of TCE in groundwater was given in 1949 by two English public chemists who described two separate instances of well contamination by industrial releases of TCE. Based on available federal and state surveys, between 9% to 34% of the drinking water supply sources tested in the U.S. may have some TCE contamination, though EPA has reported that most water supplies are in compliance with the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 5 ppb. In addition, a growing concern in recent years at sites with TCE contamination in soil or groundwater has been vapor intrusion in buildings, which has resulted in indoor air exposures, such is in a recent case in the McCook Field Neighborhood of Dayton, Ohio. Trichloroethylene has been detected in 852 Superfund sites across the United States, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, and as amended annual water quality testing is required for all public drinking water distributors. The EPA'S current guidelines for TCE can be found here. It should be noted that the EPA's table of TCE Releases to Ground is dated 1987 to 1993, thereby omitting one of the largest Superfund Cleanup sites in the nation, the NIBW in Scottsdale, Arizona. The TCE released here occurred prior to its appearance in the municipal drinking wells in 1982. This reaction can be catalyzed by a variety of substances. The most commonly used catalyst is a mixture of potassium chloride and aluminum chloride. However, various forms of porous carbon can also be used. This reaction produces tetrachloroethylene as a byproduct, and depending on the amount of chlorine fed to the reaction, tetrachloroethylene can even be the major product. Typically, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are collected together and then separated by distillation.Trichloroethylene: Parkinsonism and complex 1 mitochondrial neurotoxicity). Trichloroethylene is an effective solvent for a variety of organic materials.Trichloroethylene belongs to the family of Organochlorides.

The nephrotoxicity and nephrocarcinogenicity of TRI have been attributed to glutathione conjunction, which forms reactive, sulfur-containing metabolites. Dichloroacetic acid is known to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, while chloral hydrate inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase. Studies in rodents have shown that neurotoxic effects may be caused by trichloroethylene's incorporation into brain membranes or ability to alter the fatty acid pattern of brain phospholipids and amino acids. One of the mechanisms of trichloroethylene's carcinogenicity is believed to be the peroxisome proliferation induced by its metabolites. (L14, T12, A46)","Trichloroethylene is absorbed into the bloodstream and rapidly distributed throughout the body. Some is metabolized via cytochrome P-450 enzymes and the glutathione-conjugation pathway into metabolites such as trichloroacetic acid and trichloroethanol, which are excreted primarily in the urine.

As dieldrin is neurotoxin and tends to bioaccumulate, its use is now banned in most parts of the world. (L86) Dieldrin is a chlorinated hydrocarbon originally produced in 1948 by J. Hyman & Co, Denver, as an insecticide. Dieldrin is closely related to aldrin, which reacts further to form dieldrin. Aldrin is not toxic to insects; it is oxidized in the insect to form dieldrin which is the active compound. Both dieldrin and aldrin are named after the Diels-Alder reaction which is used to form aldrin from a mixture of norbornadiene and hexachlorocyclopentadiene.",60-57-1,969491.0,C12H8Cl6O,377.87063,White powder.,175.5°C,,"0.000195 mg/mL at 25 °C [BIGGAR,JW & RIGGS,RI (1974)]",Oral (L87)  ; inhalation (L87) ; dermal (L87),"Dieldrin antagonizes the action of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acting at the GABA-A receptors, effectively blocking the GABA-induced uptake of chloride ions. Dieldrin also inhibits Na+ K+ ATPase and Ca2+ and Mg2+ ATPase which are essential for the transport of calcium across membranes. This results in the accumulation of intracellular free calcium ions, which promotes release of neurotransmitters from storage vesicles, the subsequent depolarization of adjacent neurons, and the propagation of stimuli throughout the CNS. This results in hyperexcitation and generalized seizures. Dieldrin also binds to alpha-synuclein, leading to the formation of intracellular fibrils. (T10, L87)","Dieldrin is absorbed throught the gastrointestinal tract, lungs and skin. Following absorption, dieldrin is redistributed primarily to fat via the lymphatic system. Dieldrin is metabolized by liver microsomal monooxygenases and epoxide hydratases. Its metabolites, of which the primary one is 9-hydroxydieldrin, are excreted in the faeces.

It also affects transcription by antagonizing estrogen-related receptors. Chlordane induces hepatic cytochrome P-450, causing a large increase in the volume of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which results in hepatocellular enlargement and hypertrophy. Chlordane has also been shown to bind and activate retinoic acid receptor, causing various developmental defects, and inhibit alkaline phosphatases in hepatic and renal tissues.

DDD reduces potassium transport across the membrane. DDD inhibits the inactivation of voltaged-gated sodium channels. The channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization and resulting in a state of hyperexcitability. DDD inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. DDD also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron. DDD is also believed to adversely affect the reproductive system by mimicking endogenous hormones and binding to the estrogen and adrogen receptors. (T10, L85)","DDD is absorbed in the stomach and intestine, after which it enters the lymphatic system and is carried throughout the body and incorporated into fatty tissues.

Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are transported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin. Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The major metabolites are hydroxylated products which are excreted in the bile and faeces. The slow metabolism of PCBs means they tend to accumulate in body tissues.

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Toxaphene is absorbed through the intestines and lungs, then distributed mainly to fat tissues. Due to the complex composition of toxaphene, it requires various metabolic pathways to degrade, which involve dechlorination, dehydrodechlorination, and oxidation.

Intermediate Oral: 0.001 mg/kg/day (L134)","Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Symptoms of low dose exposure include excessive salivation and eye-watering.  Acute dose symptoms include severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions.

For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

31.0,38.0,T3D0037,Acrolein,"Acrolein (systematic name: propenal) is the simplest unsaturated aldehyde. It is a colourless liquid with a piercing, disagreeable, acrid smell. The smell of burnt fat (as when cooking oil is heated to its smoke point) is caused by glycerol in the burning fat breaking down into acrolein. It is produced industrially from propylene and mainly used as a biocide and a building block to other chemical compounds, such as the amino acid methionine. Acrolein is used as an etherification agent in the preparation of modified food starches. Acrolein is an herbicide and algicide used in water treatment. It is produced by microorganisms, e.g. Clostridium perfringens. Acrolein is a relatively electrophilic compound and a reactive one, hence its high toxicity. It is a good Michael acceptor, hence its useful reaction with thiols. It forms acetals readily, a prominent one being the spirocycle derived from pentaerythritol, diallylidene pentaerythritol. Acrolein participates in many Diels-Alder reactions, even with itself. Via Diels-Alder reactions, it is a precursor to some commercial fragrances, including lyral, norbornene-2-carboxaldehyde, and myrac aldehyde. Acrolein is toxic and is a strong irritant for the skin, eyes, and nasal passages. The main metabolic pathway for acrolein is the alkylation of glutathione. The WHO suggests a 'tolerable oral acrolein intake' of 7.5 mg/day per kilogram of body weight. Although acrolein occurs in French fries, the levels are only a few micrograms per kilogram.",107-02-8,7847.0,C3H4O,56.02622,Greenish-yellow when impure,-87.7°C,52°C,212 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L121) ; inhalation  (L121) ; dermal (L121),"Acrolein rapidly and irreversibly binds to lysine moieties and sulfhydryl groups found on many cellular molecules forming thiol ethers. By this mechanism acrolein can bind to messenger compounds to produce direct cytotoxic effects or secondary effects from interrupted cell signaling pathways. Perturbation of inflammatory responses in bronchial epithelial cells was demonstrated by direct action of acrolein on the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B (IκB) kinase, which inhibits activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) transcription factor and suppresses interleukin 8 (IL-8) production. Rapid binding of acrolein to neural receptors in the corneal and nasal mucosa results in rapid depolarization of the associated neurons to produce ocular and nasal irritation. Acrolein also binds rapidly to glutathione, which may be inhibitory to the enzyme glutathione peroxidase and result in a lower level of cellular protection against oxygen radical toxicity. Further, the adduction of glutathione generates GS-propionaldehyde, which produces oxygen and possibly hydroxy radicals via cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase. Acrolein inhibits thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase, which disrupts the cellular thiol redox balance necessary for cell survival. It interferes with normal reverse cholesterol transport by high density lipoprotein (HDL) by modifying specific sites in apolipoprotein A-I. Acrolein also inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenases and activates the transient receptor potential cation channel.

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Metabolism of organophosphates occurs principally by oxidation, by hydrolysis via esterases and by reaction with glutathione. Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.","LD50: 25 mg/kg (Dermal, Rat) (T23)

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Depending on the amount of disulfoton that enters the body, effects on the nervous system, such as narrowing of the pupils, vomiting, diarrhea, drooling, difficulty in breathing, tremors, convulsions, and even death may occur. Skin contact with disulfoton may cause weakness and fatigue. (L123)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-03-06 18:57:58+00:00,2014-12-24 20:20:56+00:00,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfoton,,C18400,,38661.0,,D004222,Disulfoton,,,1916.0,True,CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC,C8H19O2PS3,"InChI=1S/C8H19O2PS3/c1-4-9-11(12,10-5-2)14-8-7-13-6-3/h4-8H2,1-3H3",InChIKey=DOFZAZXDOSGAJZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,274.404,274.028478434,Exogenous,1,,,CHEMBL1332314,3006.0,,,,"Di-syston

39.0,46.0,T3D0045,Pentachlorophenol,"Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is an organochlorine compound used as a pesticide and a disinfectant. First produced in the 1930s, it is marketed under many trade names. It can be found in two forms: PCP itself or as the sodium salt of PCP, which dissolves easily in water. Short-term exposure to large amounts of PCP can cause harmful effects on the liver, kidneys, blood, lungs, nervous system, immune system, and gastrointestinal tract. Elevated temperature, profuse sweating, uncoordinated movement, muscle twitching, and coma are additional side effects. Contact with PCP (particularly in the form of vapor) can irritate the skin, eyes, and mouth. Long-term exposure to low levels such as those that occur in the workplace can cause damage to the liver, kidneys, blood, and nervous system. Finally exposure to PCP is also associated with carcinogenic, renal, and neurological effects. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Toxicity Class classifies PCP in group B2 (probable human carcinogen).",87-86-5,992.0,C6HCl5O,263.847,Colorless (pure) or dark gray to brown (inpure) solid.,174°C,309-310°C,0.014 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L127) ; inhalation (L127) ; dermal (L127),"Pentachlorophenol is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Pentachlorophenol is efficiently absorbed following inhalation, oral, and dermal exposure, then binds to plasma proteins and is distributed to the liver, lungs, kidneys, blood, fat tissues, and brain. Extensive plasma protein binding of pentachlorophenol may account for its low degree of metabolism. Metabolism of pentachlorophenol occurs in the liver, and the major pathways are conjugation to form the glucuronide and oxidative dechlorination to form tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ). Pentachlorophenol and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine. (L127)","LD50: 27 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T26)

Intermediate Oral: 0.001 mg/kg/day (L134)
Chronic Oral: 0.001 mg/kg/day (L134)","Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Exposure to high levels of pentachlorophenol can cause the cells in the body to produce excess heat, resulting in a very high fever, profuse sweating, and difficulty breathing. Contact with pentachlorophenol, particularly in the form of vapor can irritate the skin, eyes, and mouth. (L127, L128)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-03-06 18:57:58+00:00,2014-12-24 20:20:58+00:00,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pentachlorophenol,,C02575,,17642.0,CPD-10489,D010416,Pentachlorophenol,,PCI,1132.0,True,OC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)=C(Cl)C(Cl)=C1Cl,C6HCl5O,InChI=1S/C6HCl5O/c7-1-2(8)4(10)6(12)5(11)3(1)9/h12H,InChIKey=IZUPBVBPLAPZRR-UHFFFAOYSA-N,266.337,263.847003189,Exogenous,0,5.12,HMDB41974,CHEMBL75967,967.0,,,,"1-Hydroxy-2,3,4,5,6-pentachlorobenzene

All other toxic effects of carbon tetrachloride are related to its biotransformation via cytochrome P-450 enzymes, specifically CYP2E1. Metabolism of carbon tetrachloride by CYP2E1 may result in the destruction of the enzyme during the metabolic process, either by direct attack of radicals on the cytochrome(s) or highly localized lipid peroxidation resulting in detachment of P-450 proteins from the microsomal membranes. Reactive metabolites of carbon tetrachloride causes hepatic damage via haloalkylation of cellular macromolecules and lipid peroxidation. Carbon tetrachloride also perturbs the intracellular calcium homeostasis. Increased cytosolic levels of calcium may result from an influx of extracellular calcium caused by plasma membrane damage and decreased intracellular calcium sequestering. Higher levels of calcium activate enzymes such as proteases, which hydrolyze proteins in neighboring cells, leading to a progression of the lesion. Carbon tetrachloride's carcinogenicity is likely the result of certain reactive metabolites that bind to nuclear proteins, lipids, and DNA. (T10, L129)","Carbon tetrachloride is absorbed readily from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, and more slowly through the skin. It is distributed to all major organs, with highest concentrations in the fat, liver, bone marrow, adrenals, blood, brain, spinal cord, and kidney. Once carbon tetrachloride is absorbed, it is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 enzymes, with the production of the trichloromethyl radical. Aerobically, metabolism of the trichloromethyl radical can eventually form phosgene. Anaerobically, the radical can undergo reactions to form chloroform, hexachloroethane, or carbon monoxide. Carbon tetrachloride is excreted primarily in exhaled air and in the feces, with relatively minimal amounts in the urine.

It is composed of mainly monochlorobiphenyls (60.06%), and also includes bi-, tri, tetra-, and pentachlorinated homologs. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of 209 synthetic organic compounds with 1-10 chlorine atoms attached to biphenyl. PCBs were manufactured as commercial mixtures but banned in the 1970's because they were found to bioaccumulate in the environment and cause harmful health effects. However, PCBs do not break down readily and are still found in the environment. (L4)",11104-28-2,,C12H9Cl,,Clear oil.,,275–320 °C,"0.015 mg/mL at 25 °C [MABEY,WR et al.

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are trasported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin. Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The major metabolites are hydroxylated products which are excreted in the bile and faeces. The slow metabolism of PCBs means they tend to accumulate in body tissues.

43.0,50.0,T3D0049,Cobalt,"Cobalt has a molecular weight of 58.9 and an atomic number of 27. In the Periodic Table, close to other transition metals, it is situated in group 8, together with rhodium and iridium and it can occur in four oxidation states (0, +2, +3 and +4). The +2 and the ground state are the most common. Cobalt occurs in the minerals cobaltite (Co, Fe) AsS, smaltite (CoAs2), and erythrite Co3(AsO4)2.8H2O, and is often associated with nickel, silver, lead, copper, and iron ores, from which it is most frequently obtained as a by-product. Depending on the considered species, cobalt has multiple industrial applications including the production of alloys and hard metal, diamond polishing, drying agents, pigments and catalysts. Hard metal or cemented carbide is a powder metallurgical product consisting of hard, wear-resistant carbide particles bound together (cemented) with a ductile metal binder (i.e. metallic Co) by liquid phase sintering. Tungsten carbide (WC) is produced by mixing tungsten powder with pure carbon powder at high temperature; hereafter WC is mixed with Co powder to which paraffin is added as a binder. Depending on specific requirements related to their use, hard metals might additionally contain small quantities of chromium, niobium, molybdenum, titanium, tantalum or vanadium carbides. Inhalation and skin contact are the main occupational exposure routes. Occupational exposure to cobalt may result in adverse health effects in different organs or tissues, including the respiratory tract, the skin, the hemapoietic tissues, the myocardium or the thyroid gland. In addition, teratogenic and carcinogenic effects have been observed in experimental systems and/or in humans. For the general population, the diet constitutes the main route of exposure to cobalt, since it is an essential component of Vitamin B12 (hydroxycolalamin). Cobalt functions as a co-factor in enzyme catalysed reactions and is involved in the production of erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the formation of erythrocytes. This last property of cobalt was applied in the past as a therapy for anaemia. The carcinogenic potential of cobalt and its compounds was evaluated in 1991 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which concluded that there was inadequate evidence for carcinogenicity in humans (lung cancer) but sufficient evidence in experimental animal studies. In most experimental studies considered, the routes of exposure were, however, of questionable relevance for cancer risk assessment in humans for example, local sarcomas after intra-muscular injection. The general conclusion was that cobalt and its compounds are possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B). Since this evaluation, additional data have been accumulated which generally indicate that, depending on the considered cobalt species, different outcomes regarding toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity can be observed. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Co(II) ions are genotoxic in vitro and in vivo, and carcinogenic in rodents. Co metal is genotoxic in vitro. Hard metal dust, of which occupational exposure is linked to an increased lung cancer risk, is proven to be genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. Possibly, production of active oxygen species and/or DNA repair inhibition are mechanisms involved. Given the recently provided proof for in vitro and in vivo genotoxic potential of hard metal dust, the mechanistic evidence of elevated production of active oxygen species and the epidemiological data on increased cancer risk, it may be advisable to consider the possibility of a new evaluation by IARC.(A7687).",7440-48-4,104729.0,Co,58.933189,Grey metallic solid.,1495°C,3100°C (5612°F),,Inhalation (L29) ; oral (L29) ; dermal (L29),"Cobalt is believed to exhibit its toxicity through a oxidant-based and free radical-based processes. It produces oxygen radicals and may be oxidized to ionic cobalt, causing increased lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and inducing certain enzymes that lead to cell apoptosis. Cobalt has also been shown to block inorganic calcium channels, possibly impairing neurotransmission. Cobalt can also chelate lipoic acids, impairing oxidation of pyruvate or fatty acids. In addition, cobalt may inhibit DNA repair by interacting with zinc finger DNA repair proteins, and has also been shown to inhibit heme synthesis and glucose metabolism. Cobalt may activate specific helper T-lymphocyte cells and interact directly with immunologic proteins, such as antibodies (IgA and IgE) or Fc receptors, resulting in immunosensitization.

DDT reduces potassium transport across the membrane. DDT inhibits inactivation of the porous channels through which sodium ions pass. The channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization, causing a state of hyperexcitability. DDT inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. DDT also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron. DDT is also believed to adversely affect the reproductive system by mimicking endogenous hormones and binding to the estrogen and adrogen receptors. (T10, L85)","DDT is absorbed in the stomach and intestine, after which it enters the lymphatic system and is carried throughout the body and incorporated into fatty tissues. Metabolism of DDT occurs mainly via cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver and kidney, where it undergoes reductive dechlorination to DDD (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane) and DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene). These compounds are further degraded into additional metabolites, mainly DDA (bis(p-chlorophenyl) acetic acid), which are excreted in the urine. (L85)","LD50: 87 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L141)

It is composed of mainly trichlorobiphenyls (54.67%), and also includes mono-, bi-, tetra-, and pentachlorinated homologs. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of 209 synthetic organic compounds with 1-10 chlorine atoms attached to biphenyl. PCBs were manufactured as commercial mixtures but banned in the 1970's because they were found to bioaccumulate in the environment and cause harmful health effects. However, PCBs do not break down readily and are still found in the environment. (L4)",12674-11-2,38037.0,C12H7Cl3,255.96133,Clear oil.,,325–356 °C ,"0.00042 mg/mL at 25 °C [MABEY,WR et al.

Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are transported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin. Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The major metabolites are hydroxylated products which are excreted in the bile and faeces. The slow metabolism of PCBs means they tend to accumulate in body tissues.

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Metabolism of organophosphates occurs principally by oxidation, by hydrolysis via esterases and by reaction with glutathione. Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.","LD50: 66 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T14)

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","The symptoms associated with diazinon poisoning in humans include weakness, headaches, tightness in the chest, blurred vision, nonreactive pinpoint pupils, excessive salivation, difficulty breathing, sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and slurred speech.

Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

HPTE is an estrogen receptor alpha agonist, and also acts as an antagonist at the estrogen receptor beta and androgen receptor. This affects protein synthesis, which is believed to cause many of methoxychlor's estrogenic effects, such as decreased fertility. As methoxychlor is also a structural analogue of DDT, it is believed to have the same neurotoxic effects. This includes preventing the deactivation of the sodium gate after neuron activation and membrane depolarization, resulting in hyperexcitability of the nerve. Like DDT, methoxychlor may also inhibit neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase, which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. This contributes to the reduced rate of depolarization and increases the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron.

The DNA damage may be caused by hydroxyl radicals produced during reoxidation of pentavalent chromium by hydrogen peroxide molecules present in the cell. Trivalent chromium may also form complexes with peptides, proteins, and DNA, resulting in DNA-protein crosslinks, DNA strand breaks, DNA-DNA interstrand crosslinks, chromium-DNA adducts, chromosomal aberrations and alterations in cellular signaling pathways. It has been shown to induce carcinogenesis by overstimulating cellular regulatory pathways and increasing peroxide levels by activating certain mitogen-activated protein kinases. It can also cause transcriptional repression by cross-linking histone deacetylase 1-DNA methyltransferase 1 complexes to CYP1A1 promoter chromatin, inhibiting histone modification. Chromium may increase its own toxicity by modifying metal regulatory transcription factor 1, causing the inhibition of zinc-induced metallothionein transcription. (A12, L16, A34, A35, A36)","Chromium is absorbed from oral, inhalation, or dermal exposure and distributes to nearly all tissues, with the highest concentrations found in kidney and liver. Bone is also a major storage site and may contribute to long-term retention. Hexavalent chromium's similarity to sulfate and chromate allow it to be transported into cells via sulfate transport mechanisms.

Minor constituent of lime oil (Citrus aurantifolia).Toluene, formerly known as toluol, is a clear, water-insoluble liquid with the typical smell of paint thinners. It is an aromatic hydrocarbon that is widely used as an industrial feedstock and as a solvent. (Wikipedia) Toluene has been shown to exhibit beta-oxidant, depressant, hepatoprotective, anesthetic and neurotransmitter functions (A7693, A7694, A7695, A7696, A7697).",108-88-3,1140.0,C7H8,92.0626,Colorless liquid.,-95°C,110.6°C (231.1°F),0.526 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L174) ; inhalation (L174) ; dermal (L174),"Toluene is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Inhalation and ingestion are the primary routes of exposure, though toluene may also be absorbed through the skin. It accumulates rapidly in the brain and is subsequently deposited in other tissues according to their lipid content, with the highest levels attained in adipose tissue. The primary initial
steps in toluene metabolism is side-chain hydroxylation catalyzed predominately by the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2E1, followed by oxidation to benzoic acid. Most of the benzoic acid is then conjugated with glycine to form hippuric acid,
but a small portion can be conjugated with UDP-glucuronate to form the acyl-glucuronide. A very small portion of absorbed toluene can be converted by CYP1A2, CYP2B2, or CYP2E1 to ortho- or para-cresol. These metabolites are excreted in the urine, and the remaining toluene is exhaled unchanged. (T10, L174)","LD50: 5000 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T14)

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","The central nervous system is the primary target organ of toluene and other alkylbenzenes. Manifestations of exposure range from slight dizziness and headache to unconciousness, respiratory depression and death. Other symptoms include tiredness, confusion, weakness, memory loss, nausea, loss of appetite, and hearing and color vision loss. These symptoms usually disappear when exposure is stopped. (T10, L174)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

CDDs are a class of manufactured chemicals that consist of dioxin skeletel structures with chlorine substituents. They are also persistent organic pollutants (POPs), thus their production is regulated in most areas. Dioxins occur as by-products from the manufacture of organochlorides, the bleaching of paper, chlorination by waste and drinking water treatment plants, municipal solid waste and industrial incinerators, and natural sources such as volcanoes and forest fires.

(1988)]",Oral (L177) ; inhalation (L177) ; dermal (L177),"CDDs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor and subsequently alter the transcription of several genes (oncogenes, growth factors, receptors, hormones, and drug-metabolizing enzymes). The affinity for the Ah receptor depends on the structure of the specific CDD. The change in gene expression may result from the direct interaction of the Ah receptor and its heterodimer-forming partner, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, with gene regulatory elements or the initiation of a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade that subsequently activates other transcription factors. The change in transcription/translation of these genes is believed to be the cause of most of the toxic effects of CDDs. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin's carcinogenicity is thought to be the result of its ability to alter the capacity of both exogenous and endogenous substances to damage the DNA by inducing CYP1A1- and CYP1A2-dependent drug-metabolizing enzymes. (L177)","CDDs are absorbed through oral, inhalation, and dermal routes of exposure. CDDs are carried in the plasma by serum lipids and lipoproteins, and mainly distributed in the liver and adipose tissue. CDDs are slowly metabolized to polar metabolites by the microsomal monooxygenase system. These metabolites can undergo conjugation with glucuronic acid and glutathione. They may increase the rate of their own metabolism by inducing both phase I and phase II enzymes. The major routes of excretion of CDDs are the bile and the faeces, though smaller amounts are excreted in the urine and via lactation. (L177)","LD50: 201 ug/kg (Oral, Rat) (T26)

Sodium cacodylate is frequently used as a buffering agent in the preparation and fixation of biological samples for transmission electron microscopy. Cacodylic acid is highly toxic by ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact. Once thought to be a byproduct of inorganic arsenic detoxification, it is now believed to have serious health consequences of its own. It has been shown to be teratogenic in rodents, most often causing cleft palate but also fetal fatality at high doses. It has been shown to be genotoxic in human cells, causing apoptosis and also decreased DNA production and shorter DNA strands.

68.0,79.0,T3D0078,Naphthalene,"Naphthalene is the simplest polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) consisting of two fused benzene rings. It has a distinct, pungent odor that can be detected at levels as low as 0.08 ppm.  Naphthalene is the most abundant single component of coal tar so most of it is now industrially derived from coal tar. From the 1960s until the 1990s, significant amounts of naphthalene were also produced from heavy petroleum fractions during petroleum refining, but today petroleum-derived naphthalene represents only a minor component of naphthalene production. Naphthalene is also produced naturally with trace amounts of naphthalene being produced by black walnuts, magnolias and specific types of deer, as well as the Formosan subterranean termite. Some strains of the endophytic fungus (Muscodor albus) also produce naphthalene. Naphthalene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are released from incomplete combustion processes originating in industry, cigarette smoke and motor vehicle exhaust, as well as natural events such as forest fires. Industrially, naphthalene is used in the production of phthalic anhydride, as a solvent for chemical reactions, as a wetting agent and as a fumigant.  It is also used in pyrotechnic special effects such as the generation of black smoke and simulated explosions. In the past, naphthalene was administered orally to kill parasitic worms in livestock. Naphthalene was once the primary ingredient in mothballs, though its use has largely been replaced in favor of alternatives such as 1,4-dichlorobenzene. In a sealed container containing naphthalene pellets, naphthalene vapors build up to levels that are toxic to both the adult and larval forms of many moths. Naphthalene has been shown to exhibit apoptotic and catabolic functions (4, 5). Exposure to large amounts of naphthalene may damage or destroy red blood cells. Humans, in particular children, have developed this condition, known as hemolytic anemia, after ingesting mothballs or deodorant blocks containing naphthalene.",91-20-3,931.0,C10H8,128.0626,White crystals.,80.3°C,218°C (424.4°F),0.031 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L10); inhalation (L10),"PAH's such as naphthalene are transported throughout the body after binding blood proteins such as albumin. Binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor or glycine N-methyltransferase induces the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes (especially CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1). These cytochrome enzymes metabolize PAH's into various toxic intermediates (epoxide intermediates, dihydrodiols, phenols, quinones, and their various combinations). The reactive metabolites of PAHs covalently bind to DNA and other cellular macromolecules, initiating mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. (10, 12, 2, 3). In humans, the metabolite alpha-naphthol has been linked to the development of hemolytic anemia in some cases following ingestion or extensive dermal or inhalation exposure. Susceptibility appears to be exacerbated by a deficiency in the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme, or G-6-PD. Over 400 million people have an inherited condition called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Exposure to naphthalene is more harmful for these people and may cause hemolytic anemia at lower doses. Some naphthalene metabolites deplete glutathione stores in affected tissues such as the lungs, leading to toxicity. The metabolites responsible for glutathione depletion have been identified as naphthalene oxide or 1,2-naphthoquinone and 1,4-naphthoquinone.","PAH metabolism occurs in all tissues, usually by cytochrome P-450 and its associated enzymes. PAHs are metabolized into reactive intermediates, which include epoxide intermediates, dihydrodiols, phenols, quinones, and their various combinations. The phenols, quinones, and dihydrodiols can be conjugated to glucuronides and sulfate esters; and the quinones can form glutathione conjugates. (L10)","LD50: 490 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T29)

In humans, cataracts and other ocular injury have been reported following acute and chronic occupational exposure to naphthalene. Additional signs of toxicity in children include convulsions and coma. Infants may develop encephalopathy and kernicterus, a form of brain damage, due to the presence of increased levels of methemoglobin, hemoglobin, and bilirubin in their plasma. Naphthalene appears to be mildly carcinogenic. Rats exposed to naphthalene vapors at 10, 30, or 60 ppm for 6 hours a day, five days a week for two years developed respiratory epithelial adenomas and olfactory epithelial neuroblastomas.","Symptoms of hemolytic anemia include fatigue, lack of appetite, restlessness, and pale skin.

72.0,85.0,T3D0084,Hydrazine,"Being bifunctional, with two amines, hydrazine is a key building block for the preparation of many heterocyclic compounds via condensation with a range of difunctional electrophiles. With 2,4-pentanedione, it condenses to give the 3,5-dimethylpyrazole. In the Einhorn-Brunner reaction hydrazines react with imides to give triazoles. Hydrazine is a convenient reductant because the by-products are typically nitrogen gas and water. Thus, it is used as an antioxidant, an oxygen scavenger, and a corrosion inhibitor in water boilers and heating systems. It is also used to reduce metal salts and oxides to the pure metals in electroless nickel plating and plutonium extraction from nuclear reactor waste. Hydrazine is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula N2H4. It is a colourless liquid with an ammonia-like odor and is derived from the same industrial chemistry processes that manufacture ammonia. However, hydrazine has physical properties that are more similar to those of water. The propanone azine is an intermediate in the Atofina-PCUK synthesis. Direct alkylation of hydrazines with alkyl halides in the presence of base affords alkyl-substituted hydrazines, but the reaction is typically inefficient due to poor control on level of substitution (same as in ordinary amines). The reduction of hydrazones to hydrazines present a clean way to produce 1,1-dialkylated hydrazines.",302-01-2,9321.0,H4N2,32.03745,Colorless liquid.,2°C,,1000 mg/mL,Oral (L153); inhalation (L153) ;  dermal (L153) ,"At least two mechanisms of action have been observed. One involves the direct binding of those hydrazines with a free amino group (hydrazine and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine) to key cellular molecules. Hydrazine reacts with alpha-keto acids such as vitamin B6 to form hydrazoines compounds. By binding to keto acids and forming hydrazones, hydrazine inhibits oxygen consumption with mitochondrial substrates in vitro. A second mechanism involves the generation of reactive species such as free radical intermediates or methyldiazonium ions as a result of metabolism. (L154)","Hydrazines are likely to be more rapidly absorbed into the blood after ingestion or exposure to the skin than after inhalation. Once in the blood, they are probably carried to all the tissues of the body. Soon after exposure, the levels of hydrazines in the tissues fall since they are metabolised in several products such as acetyl-, diacetylhydrazine, pyruvate hydrazone, urea, and acyclic compound (1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxo-3-pyridazine carboxylic acid). However, these metabolites interacts with some important proteins and might be harmful to the body. Some studies showed that metabolites and unchanged hydrazine leave the body within one day.

This inhibits uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, resulting in a deficiency of the decarboxylation of uroporphyrinogen III and accumulation of uroporphyrins in the liver. In addition, metabolism of hexachlorobenzene by the cytochrome P-450 enzymes is believed to produce reactive electrophilic metabolites that covalently bind to cellular proteins and DNA, causing irreversible damage. Exposure to hexochlorobenzene also causes macrophages to be attracted to organs such as the spleen, lungs, and skin, where they become activated by the hexochlorobenzene. This leads to a cascade of reactions involving innate immune cells. The gene expression profiles provide evidence for the importance of macrophages and granulocytes and mediators released by these cells in the adverse inflammatory response against hexochlorobenzene. In this way, co-stimulatory or danger signals are generated that could polyclonally activate T cells. Hexachlorobenzene is a weak agonist for aryl hydrocarbon receptor and may exhibit some of its toxic effects by activating the gene-regulatory properties of this protein, possibly inducing cytochome P-450 enzymes. It may also act at certain endocrine receptors. (A14, L225, A156, A157, A60)","Hexachlorobenzene is mainly absorbed via ingestion, but also through inhalation and oral routes. It preferentially distributes to adipose tissue and other organs with high fat content. In animals, hexachlorobenzene is slowly metabolized to pentachlorophenol by the hepatic cytochrome P-450 system, conjugated with glutathione to yield pentachlorothiophenol, or reductively dechlorinated to form pentachlorobenzene. Other metabolites include less chlorinated benzenes, chlorophenols, S-conjugated phenols, and benzenes.

83.0,98.0,T3D0097,"1,1,1-Trichloroethane","1,1,1-Trichloroethane is generally considered as a polar solvent. Owing to its unsymmetrical structure, it is a superior solvent for organic compounds that do not dissolve well in hydrocarbons such as hexane. It is an excellent solvent for many organic materials and also one of the least toxic of the chlorinated hydrocarbons. Prior to the Montreal Protocol, it was widely used for cleaning metal parts and circuit boards, as a photoresist solvent in the electronics industry, as an aerosol propellant, as a cutting fluid additive, and as a solvent for inks, paints, adhesives and other coatings. 1,1,1-Trichloroethane is marketed with stabilizers since it is unstable with respect to dehydrochlorination and attacks some metals. Stabilizers comprise up to 8% of the formulation, including acid scavengers (epoxides, amines) and complexants. The Montreal Protocol targeted 1,1,1-trichloroethane as one of those compounds responsible for ozone depletion and banned its use beginning in 1996. Since then, its manufacture and use has been phased out throughout most of the world. The organic compound 1,1,1-trichloroethane, also known as methyl chloroform, is a chloroalkane. This colourless, sweet-smelling liquid was once produced industrially in large quantities for use as a solvent. It is regulated by the Montreal Protocol as an ozone-depleting substance and its use is being rapidly phased out.",71-55-6,6278.0,C2H3Cl3,131.93003,Colorless liquid.,-30.4°C,"74 °C (347°K, 165 °F)",1.29 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L306); inhalation (L306) ;  dermal (L306) ,"1,1,1-Trichloroethane is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Upon first exposure, 1,1,1-trichloroethane is rapidly and efficiently absorbed by the lung, skin, and gastrointestinal tract of humans. 1,1,1-Trichloroethane is distributed by the blood to tissues and organs throughout the body, including to developing fetuses, with preferential distribution to fatty tissues. The predominant pathway of elimination of 1,1,1-trichloroethane in humans, regardless of route of exposure, is exhalation of the unchanged compound. 1,1,1-Trichloroethane is metabolized oxidatively, at low rates, to trichloroethanol and trichloroacetic acid by the cytochrome P-450 mixed-function oxidase system. These metabolites are excreted in the urine, and other minor metabolites (carbon dioxide [CO2] and acetylene) are excreted in expired air. (L304)","LD50: 11 240 mg/kg (Oral, Mouse) (L304)

In the home, it is used as an ingredient of products such as spot cleaners, glues, and aerosol sprays. No 1,1,1-trichloroethane is supposed to be manufactured for domestic use in the United States after January 1, 2002, because it affects the ozone layer.

Intermediate Oral: 20 mg/kg/day (Mouse) (L304)","Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Symptoms include cough, sore throat, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, ataxia, unconsciousness.

If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

(L311, A186)","Ethylbenzene is metabolized mainly through hydroxylation and then through conjugation reactions from which numerous metabolites have been isolated. Hydroxylation of ethylbenzene to 1-phenylethanol is catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 isoforms CYP2E1 and CYP2B6. 1-Phenylethanol is conjugated to glucuronide, which then is either excreted or converted to subsequent metabolites. Oxidation of 1-phenylethanol yields acetophenone, which is both excreted in the urine as a minor metabolite and further transformed. Continued oxidation of the side chain leads to the sequential formation of 2-hydroxyacetophenone, 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol, mandelic acid, and phenylglyoxylic acid. Minor pathways (e.g., ring hydroxylation) include glucuronide and sulfate conjugation with hydroxylated derivatives to form glucuronides and sulfates that are excreted in the urine. In humans exposed via inhalation, the major metabolites of ethylbenzene in the urine are mandelic acid (70%) and phenylglyoxylic acid (25%). Following dermal exposure of humans, however, excretion of mandelic acid was shown to be only 4.6% of the absorbed dose, which may indicate differences in the metabolic fate between inhalation and dermal exposure routes.

DNOC produces its accelerative effect by increasing the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to Ca+, altering the proton electrochemical gradient and thus interrupting the phosphate transfer to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to form ATP. Uncoupling allows electron transport to proceed unchecked even when ATP synthesis is inhibited. As a consequence, more ADP and inorganic phosphate are available to drive the TCA cycle, and most of the energy produced from catabolism of glucose is not stored in high energy phosphate bonds as ATP but is given off as heat.

It primarily targets the central nervous system, particularily the globus pallidus of the basal ganglia. It is believed that the manganese ion, Mn(II), enhances the autoxidation or turnover of various intracellular catecholamines, leading to increased production of free radicals, reactive oxygen species, and other cytotoxic metabolites, along with a depletion of cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms, leading to oxidative damage and selective destruction of dopaminergic neurons. In addition to dopamine, manganese is thought to interact with other neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glutamate. Manganese overwhelms the manganese superoxide dismutase and produce oxidative damage. The neurotoxicity of Mn(II) has also been linked to its ability to substitute for Ca(II) under physiological conditions. It can enter mitochondria via the calcium uniporter and inhibit mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. It may also inhibit the efflux of Ca(II), which can result in a loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity. Mn(II) has been shown to inhibit mitochondrial aconitase activity to a significant level, altering amino acid metabolism and cellular iron homeostasis.

It potently affects the release of neurotransmitter from presynaptic nerve terminals. Methylmercury alters calcium ion concentrations by at least two mechanisms. First, it disrupts regulation of Ca2+ from an intracellular Ca2+ pool and second, it increases the permeability of the plasma membrane to Ca2+. Methylmercury also blocks plasma membrane voltage-dependent Ca2+ and Na+ channels in addition to activating a nonspecific transmembrane cation conductance. Chronic Methylmercury exposure results in ultrastructural changes and accumulation of Methylmercury within mitochondria. In vitro, Methylmercury inhibits several mitochondrial enzymes and depolarizes the mitochondria membrane subsequently reducing ATP production and Ca2+ buffering capacity. Inhibition of protein synthesis is observed after in vivo or in vitro exposures of Methylmercury and may be an early effect of Methylmercury poisoning. Organic mercury exerts developmental effects by binding to tubulin, preventing microtubule assembly and causing mitotic inhibition (A15097)","Ingested methylmercury is readily and completely absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. Methylmercury has a half-life in human blood of about 50 days. Organic mercury complexes with free cysteine and the cysteine and sulfhydryl groups on proteins such as haemoglobin. The methylmercuric-cysteinyl complex is recognized by amino acid transporting proteins in the body as methionine, another essential amino acid. Because of this mimicry, it is transported freely throughout the body including across the blood–brain barrier and across the placenta, where it is absorbed by the developing fetus. Also for this reason as well as its strong binding to proteins, methylmercury is not readily eliminated.  Because methylmercury is formed in aquatic systems and because it is not readily eliminated from organisms it is biomagnified. Organic mercury is metabolized into inorganic mercury, which is eventually excreted in the urine and faeces. (6)","LD50: 58 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T41)

Exposure to high levels of metallic, inorganic, or organic mercury can permanently damage the brain, kidneys, and developing fetus. Effects on brain functioning may result in irritability, shyness, tremors, changes in vision or hearing, and memory problems. Acrodynia, a type of mercury poisoning in children, is characterized by pain and pink discoloration of the hands and feet. Mercury poisoning can also cause Hunter-Russell syndrome and Minamata disease. (L7)","Chronic Exposure:Common symptoms include peripheral neuropathy, skin discoloration, edema, and desquamation. (1) 
Acute Exposure: Symptoms of ingestion within the first few minutes may include pain, profuse vomiting and severe purging and the victim may die within a few hours from peripheral vascular collapse secondary to fluid and electrolyte loss. Primary gastroenteritis may subside spontaneously within a few days but severe hemorrhagic inflammation of the colon (colitis) has occurred as late as 9 days following ingestion. A second phase developing over 1-3 days is characterized by stomatitis (lesions of the mouth parts), membranous colitis and kidney damage (tubular nephritis). This second phase is associated with a slow and prolonged excretion of mercury by salivary glands, the gastrointestinal mucosa and kidneys. Death in this phase usually occurs as a result of kidney failure.

111.0,128.0,T3D0127,Chlorpyrifos,"Chlorpyrifos (IUPAC name: O,O-diethyl O-3,5,6-trichloropyridin-2-yl phosphorothioate) is a crystalline organophosphate insecticide. It was introduced in 1965 by Dow Chemical Company and is known by many trade names (see table), including Dursban and Lorsban. It acts on the nervous system of insects by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. Chlorpyrifos is moderately toxic to humans, and exposure has been linked to neurological effects, persistent developmental disorders, and autoimmune disorders. Exposure during pregnancy retards the mental development of children, and most use in homes has been banned since 2001 in the U.S. In agriculture, it remains one of the most widely used organophosphate insecticides, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).",2921-88-2,2730.0,C9H11Cl3NO3PS,348.92628,White crystals.,42°C,,0.00112 mg/mL at 24°C,Oral (L268) ; inhalation (L268) ; dermal (L268),"Chlorpyrifos is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Metabolism of organophosphates occurs principally by oxidation, by hydrolysis via esterases and by reaction with glutathione. Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.","LD50: 102 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T42)

On the farm, it is used to control ticks on cattle and as a spray to control crop pests. (L268)","Acute Oral: 0.003 mg/kg/day (L134)
Intermediate Oral: 0.003 mg/kg/day (L134)
Chronic Oral: 0.001 mg/kg/day (L134)","Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Chlorpyrifos exposure may produce a variety of effects on the nervous system including headaches, blurred vision, lacrimation, excessive salivation, runny nose, dizziness, confusion, muscle weakness or tremors, nausea, diarrhea, and sudden changes in heart rate. High levels may result in severe sweating, loss of bowel control, severe muscle tremors, seizures, loss of consciousness, coma, or death. (L268)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase.

119.0,136.0,T3D0135,Guthion,"Guthion, also called azinphos-methyl, is a synthetic organophosphorous pesticide. It has been used on many different crops, especially apples, pears, cherries, peaches, almonds, and cotton. Due to its toxicity, its use has been banned or tightly regulated in most areas today. (L580)",86-50-0,2268.0,C10H12N3O3PS2,317.00577,Colorless to white crystals.,73°C,,"0.0209 mg/mL at 20 °C [BOWMAN,BT & SANS,WW (1983)]",Oral (L580) ; dermal (L580) ; inhalation (L580) ,"Guthion is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Metabolism of organophosphates occurs principally by oxidation, by hydrolysis via esterases and by reaction with glutathione. Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.","LD50: 11 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T87)

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Guthion interferes with the nerves and brain normal way. Exposure to very high levels of guthion for a short period in air, water, or food may cause difficulty breathing, chest tightness, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea, blurred vision, sweating, headaches, dizziness, loss of consciousness, and death. (L580)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

It is a dense, mobile, slightly transparent reddish-brown liquid, that evaporates easily at standard temperature and pressures to give an orange vapor (its color resembles nitrogen dioxide) that has a strongly disagreeable odor resembling that of chlorine. It is one of only two elements on the periodic table that are known to be liquids at room temperature (the other being mercury). Bromine is corrosive and toxic, with properties between those of chlorine and iodine. Free bromine does not occur in nature, but occurs as colorless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous to table salt. Bromine is used in the preparation of brominated flame retardants, it is also used in the preparation of gas additives and pesticides. Bromide compounds, especially potassium bromide, were frequently used as general sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Bromides in the form of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine, although the latter use varies from country to country. Bromine has been long believed to have no essential function in mammals, but recent research suggests that bromine is necessary for tissue development. In addition, bromine is used preferentially over chlorine by one antiparasitic enzyme in the human immune system. Organobromides are needed and produced enzymatically from bromide by some lower life forms in the sea, particularly algae.

It may reduce potassium transport across the membrane. Dicofol also alters the porous channels through which sodium ions pass. These channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization. Dicofol inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. Dicofol also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron. Difocol is also an endocrine disruptor and binds both the androgen and estrogen receptor. In addition, it may alter sex hormone metabolism by directly inhibiting cytochrome P-450 19A1. Difocol is able to competitively bind transthyretin, which lowers plasma thyroid hormone levels. (T10, A214, A228, A229)","Dicofol can be absorbed via oral, inhahation, and dermal routes. It is distributed primarily to the adipose tissue, as well as the adrenal glands, thyroid, and liver.

Also called parathion-ethyl or diethyl parathion, parathion is an organophosphate compound. As parathion is highly toxic to non-target organisms, its use is banned or restricted in many areas.

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Metabolism of organophosphates occurs principally by oxidation, by hydrolysis via esterases and by reaction with glutathione. Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.","LD50: 2 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T14)

(L633)",,"Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Parathion exposure can result in headaches, convulsions, poor vision, vomiting, abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, unconsciousness, tremor, dyspnea, and finally lung-edema as well as respiratory arrest.

If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

129.0,147.0,T3D0146,"1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane","1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane is a chlorinated derivative of ethane. It has the highest solvent power of any chlorinated hydrocarbon. As a refrigerant, it is used under the name R-130. It was once widely used as a solvent and as an intermediate in the industrial production of trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and 1,2-dichloroethylene. 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane was also used to separate fats and oils from other substances, to clean and degrease metals, and in paints and pesticides. However, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane is no longer used much in the United States due to concerns about its toxicity. Less toxic chemicals are now available to replace this solvent, and largescale commercial production has stopped, although some production still occurs (L336, L338).",79-34-5,6591.0,C2H2Cl4,165.89106,,-43.8°C,,"2.83 mg/mL at 25 °C [HORVATH,AL et al. (1999)]",Oral (L340) ; inhalation (L340) ; eye contact (L340) ; dermal contact (L340),"The presence of the functional group consisting of a terminal dichloromethyl moiety in a molecule is known to confer toxicity. Moreover, the metabolism of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane to reactive products is also likely to play a key role in its toxicity. Both nuclear and microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes (of the CYPIIA, CYPIIB, CYPIIE, and CYPIIIA subfamilies) have been implicated in the metabolism of the compound, possibly releasing a number of biologically active compounds, including aldehydes, alkenes, acids, and free radicals that may react with biological tissues. In general, the highly lipophilic nature of chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, allows them to cross the blood-brain barrier readily and partition into lipids in neuronal membranes. This property allows them to interfere with neural membrane function, bringing about central nervous system depression, behavioral changes, and anesthesia. 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane has been shown to bind to DNA in the liver and several other organs, indicating that this mechanism may contribute to the carcinogenic process. Several studies of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane toxicity have reported increases in the number of hepatocytes in mitosis, but the possible role these effects may have on the carcinogenicity of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane has not been evaluated. (L336)","1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane appears to be distributed throughout the body, but may selectively accumulate to a degree in certain cells and tissues. Because it is a volatile, lipophilic molecule of small molecular size that appears to be readily absorbed from the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, passive diffusion is the most likely mechanism of absorption. The metabolism of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane proceeds via multiple pathways. The predominant pathway appears to involve production of dichloroacetic acid, formed as an initial metabolite via stagewise hydrolytic cleavage of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, or by cytochrome P450-based oxidation of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane. Dichloroacetic acid has been identified as the major urinary metabolite. Dichloroacetic acid can be further metabolized to glyoxylic acid, formic acid, and carbon dioxide, with carbon dioxide a potential major component of the end products. Other pathways involve the formation of trichloroethylene or tetrachloroethylene as initial metabolites, with subsequent reactions yielding trichloroethanol, trichloroacetic acid, and oxalic acid as important end products. Metabolism of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane is generally extensive, with 68% or more of a total administered dose found as metabolites. Following absorption into the body, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane is eliminated mainly as metabolites in the urine and as carbon dioxide and unchanged compound in expired air.

130.0,148.0,T3D0147,Selenium,"Selenium is a nonmetal element with the atomic number 34 and the chemical symbol Se. Isolated selenium occurs in several different forms, the most stable of which is a dense purplish-gray semiconductor form. Selenium rarely occurs in its elemental state in nature and is usually found in sulfide ores such as pyrite, partially replacing the sulfur in the ore matrix. It may also be found in silver, copper, lead, and nickel minerals. Selenium is mainly used in the electronics industry, in glassmaking, and in chemicals and pigments. Though selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, trace amounts of the element are necessary for cellular function in most animals, forming the active center of the enzymes glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, and three known deiodinase enzymes. (L620)",7782-49-2,107674.0,Se,79.916519,Gray to black crystals.,221°C,684.9°C (1264.8°F),,Oral(L619) ; inhalation (L619) ; dermal (L619).,"Selenium readily substitutes for sulfur in biomolecules and in many biochemical reactions, especially when the concentration of selenium is high and the concentration of sulfur is low. Inactivation of the sulfhydryl enzymes necessary for oxidative reactions in cellular respiration, through effects on mitochondrial and microsomal electron transport, might contribute to acute selenium toxicity. Selenomethionine (a common organic selenium compound) also appears to randomly substitute for methionine in protein synthesis. This substitution may affect the structure and functionability of the protein, for example, by altering disulfide bridges. Inorganic forms of selenium appear to react with tissue thiols by redox catalysis, resulting in formation of reactive oxygen species and causing damage by oxidative stress. (L619)","Selenium may be absorbed through inhalation and ingestion, while some selenium compounds may also be absorbed dermally. Once in the body, selenium is distributed mainly to the liver and kidney. Selenium is an essential micronutrient and is a component of glutathione peroxidase, iodothyronine 5'-deiodinases, and thioredoxin reductase. Organic selenium is first metabolized into inorganic selenium. Inorganic selenium is reduced stepwise to the intermediate hydrogen selenide, which is either incorporated into selenoproteins after being transformed to selenophosphate and selenocysteinyl tRNA or excreted into the urine after being transformed into methylated metabolites of selenide. Elemental selenium is also methylated before excretion. Selenium is primarily eliminated in the urine and feces, but certain selenium compounds may also be exhaled.

It may also be found in pigments in plastics, paints, enamels, inks, and rubber. (L619)",Chronic Oral: 0.005 mg/kg/day (L134),"Chronic oral exposure to high concentrations of selenium compounds can produce a disease called selenosis.

132.0,152.0,T3D0151,"O,P'-DDD","DDD, O,P'- is an isomer of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, an organochlorine insecticide. It is a component of commercial mixtures of DDT. DDT was once a widely used pesticide, but today its agricultural use has been banned worldwide due to its toxicity and tendency to bioaccumulate. However, it still has limited use in disease vector control. (L84). It is a derivative of the insecticide  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane that specifically inhibits cells of the adrenal cortex and their production of hormones. It is used to treat adrenocortical tumors and causes CNS damage, but no bone marrow depression.

DDD reduces potassium transport across the membrane. DDD inhibits the inactivation of voltaged-gated sodium channels. The channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization and resulting in a state of hyperexcitability. DDD inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. DDD also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron. DDD is also believed to adversely affect the reproductive system by mimicking endogenous hormones and binding to the estrogen and adrogen receptors. (T10, L85)","DDD is absorbed in the stomach and intestine, after which it enters the lymphatic system and is carried throughout the body and incorporated into fatty tissues. Metabolism of DDD occurs mainly via cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver and kidney. Its metabolites, mainly DDA (bis(p-chlorophenyl) acetic acid), are excreted in the urine. (L85)Route of Elimination: A variable amount of metabolite (1%-17%) is excreted in the bile and the balance is apparently stored in the tissues.Half Life: 18-159 days","LD50: 113 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L138)",5 g/kg for an adult human.

(L84). It is also used for treatment of inoperable adrenocortical tumours; Cushing's syndrome",,"DDT has been shown to cause mild anemia. Exposure to DDT causes loss of weight and anorexia. DDT poisoning affects CNS function in humans, but pathologic changes are observed in the liver and reproductive organs. Hypertrophy of hepatocytes and subcellular organelles such as mitochondria, proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, centrolobular necrosis after exposure to high concentrations, and an increase in the incidence of hepatic tumors have been noted. (T10)",DDT exposure causes ataxia and abnormal stepping. Acute signs of DDT poisoning include paresthesia after oral ingestion. Studies have shown that a mammal poisoned with DDT-type agents displays periodic persistent tremoring and/or convulsive seizures that are suggestive of repetitive discharges in neurons. These repetitive tremors and seizures can be initiated by tactile and auditory stimuli. (T10),"Treatment of DDT exposure should be primarily directed towards decontamination and supportive care, as there is no specific antidote. The use of gastric lavage and activated charcoal for large ingestions may be effective.

134.0,157.0,T3D0156,"1,3-Butadiene","1,3-Butadiene is a simple conjugated diene with the formula C4H6. It is an important industrial chemical used as a monomer in the production of synthetic rubber. When the word butadiene is used, most of the time it refers to 1,3-butadiene. 1,3-Butadiene is inconvenient for laboratory use because it is a flammable gas subject to polymerization on storage. 3-Butadiene cyclic sulfone (sulfolene) is a convenient solid storable source for 1,3-butadiene for many laboratory purposes when the generation of sulfur dioxide byproduct in the reaction mixture is not objectionable. Long-term exposure has been associated with cardiovascular disease, there is a consistent association with leukemia, and weaker association with other cancers. Most butadiene is polymerized to produce synthetic rubber. While polybutadiene itself is a very soft, almost liquid material, copolymers prepared from mixtures of butadiene with styrene and/or acrylonitrile, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), acrylonitrile butadiene (NBR) and styrene-butadiene (SBR) are tough and elastic. SBR is the material most commonly used for the production of automobile tires. Smaller amounts of butadiene are used to make the nylon intermediate, adiponitrile, by the addition of a molecule of hydrogen cyanide to each of the double bonds in a process called hydrocyanation developed by DuPont. Other synthetic rubber materials such as chloroprene, and the solvent sulfolane are also manufactured from butadiene. Butadiene is used in the industrial production of 4-vinylcyclohexene via a Diels Alder dimerization reaction and the vinylcyclohexene is a common impurity found in butadiene upon storage. Cyclooctadiene and cyclododecatriene are produced via nickel- or titanium-catalyzed dimerization and trimerization reactions, respectively. Butadiene is also useful in the synthesis of cycloalkanes and cycloalkenes, as it reacts with double and triple carbon-carbon bonds through the Diels-Alder reaction. The name butadiene can also refer to the isomer, 1,2-butadiene, which is a cumulated diene. However, this allene is difficult to prepare and has no industrial significance. This diene is also not expected to act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction due to its structure. To effect a Diels-Alder reaction only a conjugated diene will suffice.",106-99-0,7845.0,C4H6,54.04695,Colorless gas.,-108.9°C,,0.735 mg/mL at 25°C,Inhalation (L990),"Certain metabolites of 1,3-butadiene have been shown to bind to DNA and nucleoproteins, forming protein-DNA and DNA-DNA crosslinks.

135.0,158.0,T3D0157,Ammonia,"Ammonia is a colourless alkaline gas and is one of the most abundant nitrogen-containing compounds in the atmosphere. It is an irritant with a characteristic pungent odor that is widely used in industry. Inasmuch as ammonia is highly soluble in water and, upon inhalation, is deposited in the upper airways, occupational exposures to ammonia have commonly been associated with sinusitis, upper airway irritation, and eye irritation. Acute exposures to high levels of ammonia have also been associated with diseases of the lower airways and interstitial lung. Small amounts of ammonia are naturally formed in nearly all tissues and organs of the vertebrate organism. Ammonia is both a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. In fact, it is the most common endogenous neurotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that causes damage to neural tissue and neural cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Ammonia is recognized to be central in the pathogenesis of a brain condition known as hepatic encephalopathy, which arises from various liver diseases and leads to a build up ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia). More than 40% of people with cirrhosis develop hepatic encephalopathy. Part of the neurotoxicity of ammonia arises from the fact that it easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and is absorbed and metabolized by the astrocytes, a population of cells in the brain that constitutes 30% of the cerebral cortex. Astrocytes use ammonia when synthesizing glutamine from glutamate. The increased levels of glutamine lead to an increase in osmotic pressure in the astrocytes, which become swollen. There is increased activity of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, and the energy supply to other brain cells is decreased. This can be thought of as an example of brain edema. The source of the ammonia leading to hepatic encephalopathy is not entirely clear. The gut produces ammonia, which is metabolized in the liver, and almost all organ systems are involved in ammonia metabolism. Colonic bacteria produce ammonia by splitting urea and other amino acids, however this does not fully explain hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. The alternative explanation is that hyperammonemia is the result of intestinal breakdown of amino acids, especially glutamine. The intestines have significant glutaminase activity, predominantly located in the enterocytes. On the other hand, intestinal tissues only have a little glutamine synthetase activity, making it a major glutamine-consuming organ. In addition to the intestine, the kidney is an important source of blood ammonia in patients with liver disease. Ammonia is also taken up by the muscle and brain in hepatic coma, and there is confirmation that ammonia is metabolized in muscle. Excessive formation of ammonia in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients has also been demonstrated, and it has been shown that some Alzheimer's disease patients exhibit elevated blood ammonia concentrations. Ammonia is the most important natural modulator of lysosomal protein processing. Indeed, there is strong evidence for the involvement of aberrant lysosomal processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in the formation of amyloid deposits. Inflammatory processes and activation of microglia are widely believed to be implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Ammonia is able to affect the characteristic functions of microglia, such as endocytosis, and cytokine production. Based on these facts, an ammonia-based hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease has been suggested (PMID: 17006913, 16167195, 15377862, 15369278). Chronically high levels of ammonia in the blood are associated with nearly twenty different inborn errors of metabolism including: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, 3-methyl-crotonylglycinuria, argininemia, argininosuccinic aciduria, beta-ketothiolase deficiency, biotinidase deficiency, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency, carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency, citrullinemia type I, hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome, hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome, isovaleric aciduria, lysinuric protein intolerance, malonic aciduria, methylmalonic aciduria, methylmalonic aciduria due to cobalamin-related disorders, propionic acidemia, pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, and short chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD deficiency). Many of these inborn errors of metabolism are associated with urea cycle disorders or impairment to amino acid metabolism. High levels of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia) lead to the activation of NMDA receptors in the brain. This results in the depletion of brain ATP, which in turn leads to release of glutamate. Ammonia also leads to the impairment of mitochondrial function and calcium homeostasis, thereby decreasing ATP synthesis. Excess ammonia also increases the formation of nitric oxide (NO), which in turn reduces the activity of glutamine synthetase, and thereby decreases the elimination of ammonia in the brain (PMID: 12020609). As a neurotoxin, ammonia predominantly affects astrocytes. Disturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, factors implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, appear to be involved in the mechanism of ammonia neurotoxicity. Ammonia can also affect the glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, the two prevailing neuronal systems of the cortical structures. All of these effects can lead to irreversible brain damage, coma, and/or death. Infants with urea cycle disorders and hyperammonemia initially exhibit vomiting and increasing lethargy. If untreated, seizures, hypotonia (poor muscle tone, floppiness), respiratory distress (respiratory alkalosis), and coma can occur. Adults with urea cycle disorders and hyperammonemia will exhibit episodes of disorientation, confusion, slurred speech, unusual and extreme combativeness or agitation, stroke-like symptoms, lethargy, and delirium. Ammonia also has toxic effects when an individual is exposed to ammonia solutions. Acute exposure to high levels of ammonia in air may be irritating to skin, eyes, throat, and lungs and cause coughing and burns. Lung damage and death may occur after exposure to very high concentrations of ammonia. Swallowing concentrated solutions of ammonia can cause burns in the mouth, throat, and stomach. Splashing ammonia into eyes can cause burns and even blindness.",7664-41-7,222.0,H3N,17.02655,Colorless gas.,-77.7°C,,"482 mg/mL at 24°C [DEAN,JA (1985)]",Oral (L958) ; inhalation (L958) ;  dermal (L958),"The topical damage caused by ammonia is probably due mainly to its alkaline properties. Its high water solubility allows it to dissolve in moisture on the mucous membranes, skin, and eyes, forming ammonium hydroxide. Ammonium hydroxide causes saponification of cell membrane lipids, resulting in cell disruption and death. Additionally, it extracts water from the cells and initiates an inflammatory response, which further damages the surrounding tissues. Excess circulating levels of ammonia (hyperammonemia) can cause serious neurological effects. This is thought to involve the alteration of glutamate metabolism in the brain and resultant increased activation of NMDA receptors, which causes decreased protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of Na+/K+ ATPase, increased activity of Na+/K+ ATPase, and depletion of ATP. Ammonia can chemically interact with an internal thiolester bond of
complement 3 (C3). This causes a conformation change in C3, which activates the alternative complement pathway, causing the release of chemoattractants and the assembly of the membrane attack complex of complement. The altered C3 can also bind directly to phagocyte complement receptors, which causes the release of toxic oxygen species. (L958)","Ammonia can be absorbed by inhalation and oral routes exposure, and also to a much lesser extent through the skin and eyes. Most of the inhaled ammonia is retained in the upper respiratory tract and is subsequently eliminated in expired air, while ingested ammonia is readily absorbed in the intestinal tract. Ammonia that reaches the circulation is widely distributed to all body compartments although substantial first pass metabolism occurs in the liver where it is transformed into urea and glutamine. Ammonia or ammonium ion reaching the tissues is taken up by glutamic acid, which participates in transamination and other reactions. Ammonia is mainly excreted in the urine. (L958)","LD50: 350 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (A591)
LC50: 3360 mg/m3 over 1 hour (Inhalation, Mouse) (A591)
Severe hyperammonemia is characterized by serum ammonia levels greater than 1000 μmol/L",2500 to 4500 ppm over 30 minutes for an adult human. (L958),No indication of carcinogenicity to humans (not listed by IARC).,"Ammonia is used directly on farm crops, and is also a precursor to foodstuffs and fertilizers. It is also found in many household and industrial cleaners. (L958)","Acute Inhalation: 1.7 ppm (L134)
Chronic Inhalation: 0.1 ppm (L134)","Acute exposure to high levels of ammonia in air may be irritating to skin, eyes, throat, and lungs and cause coughing and burns. Lung damage and death may occur after exposure to very high concentrations of ammonia. Swallowing concentrated solutions of ammonia can cause burns in mouth, throat, and stomach. Splashing ammonia into eyes can cause burns and even blindness. (L958)

Chronically high levels of ammonia in the blood are associated with nearly 20 different inborn errors of metabolism including: 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Lyase Deficiency, Argininemia, Argininosuccinic Aciduria, Beta-Ketothiolase Deficiency, Biotinidase deficiency, Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase Deficiency, Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency, Citrullinemia Type I, Hyperinsulinism-Hyperammonemia Syndrome, Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome, Isovaleric Aciduria, Lysinuric Protein Intolerance, Malonic Aciduria, Methylmalonic Aciduria, Methylmalonic Aciduria Due to Cobalamin-Related Disorders, Propionic acidemia, Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency and Short Chain Acyl CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (SCAD Deficiency). Hyperammonemia is one of the metabolic derangements that contribute to hepatic encephalopathy.","Acute exposure leads to irritation and burning at the site of exposure. (L958)
Symptoms include cough, chest pain (severe), chest tightness, difficulty breathing and wheezing, tearing and burning of eyes, temporary blindness, throat pain (severe), mouth pain, lip swelling, heart and blood, rapid, weak pulse, collapse and shock.
Chronic exposure: Symptoms of hyperammonia include: lethargy, irritability, poor feeding, vomiting and seizures. Signs and symptoms of late-onset hyperammonemia (later in life) may include intermittent ataxia, intellectual impairment, failure to thrive, gait abnormality, behavior disturbances, epilepsy, recurrent Reye syndrome and protein avoidance.","Acute Exposure: EYES: irrigate opened eyes for several minutes under running water. INGESTION: do not induce vomiting. Rinse mouth with water (never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person). Seek immediate medical advice. SKIN: should be treated immediately by rinsing the affected parts in cold running water for at least 15 minutes, followed by thorough washing with soap and water. If necessary, the person should shower and change contaminated clothing and shoes, and then must seek medical attention. INHALATION: supply fresh air. If required provide artificial respiration.

Chronic Exposure: Intravenous arginine (argininosuccinase deficiency), sodium phenylbutyrate and sodium benzoate (ornithine transcarbamoylase deficiency) are pharmacologic agents commonly used as adjunctive therapy to treat hyperammonemia in patients.",2009-03-06 18:58:11+00:00,2018-03-21 17:46:11+00:00,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia,,C00014,"102770

136.0,159.0,T3D0158,2-Methylnaphthalene,"2-Methylnaphthalene is one of over 100 different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning organic substances, such as fossil fuels. They are usually found as a mixture containing two or more of these compounds. (L10)",91-57-6,7055.0,C11H10,142.07825,White powder.,34.4°C,,"0.0246 mg/mL at 25 °C [YALKOWSKY,SH & DANNENFELSER,RM (1992)]",Oral (L10) ; inhalation (L10),"The ability of PAH's to bind to blood proteins such as albumin allows them to be transported throughout the body. Many PAH's induce the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1, by binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor or glycine N-methyltransferase protein. These enzymes metabolize PAH's into their toxic intermediates. The reactive metabolites of PAHs (epoxide intermediates, dihydrodiols, phenols, quinones, and their various combinations) covalently bind to DNA and other cellular macromolecules, initiating mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. (L10, L23, A27, A32)","PAH metabolism occurs in all tissues, usually by cytochrome P-450 and its associated enzymes. PAHs are metabolized into reactive intermediates, which include epoxide intermediates, dihydrodiols, phenols, quinones, and their various combinations. The phenols, quinones, and dihydrodiols can all be conjugated to glucuronides and sulfate esters; the quinones also form glutathione conjugates.

(L135)","PAHs are released into the environment via the combustion of fossil fuels, coke oven emissions and vehicle exhausts, as well as naturally from forest fires and voLcanic eruptions. PAHs from these sources may contaminate nearly water systems. They are also found in coal tar and charbroiled food. 2-Methylnaphthalene is used to make other chemicals such as dyes and resins. (L10, L12)",,"PAHs are carcinogens and have been associated with the increased risk of skin, respiratory tract, bladder, stomach, and kidney cancers. They may also cause reproductive effects and depress the immune system. Exposure to large amounts of 2-methylnapthalene may damage or destroy the red blood cells, resulting in hemolytic anemia. (L10, L12)","Acute exposure to PAHs causes irritation and inflammation of the skin and lung tissue. Some symptoms of hemolytic anemia are fatigue, lack of appetite, restlessness, and pale skin. Exposure to large amounts of  2-methylnapthalene may also cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in the urine, and a yellow color to the skin. (A10, L12)

In terms of its structure, the molecule consists of two chlorine atoms substituted for hydrogen at opposing sites on a benzene ring. p-DCB is used a pesticide and a deodorant, most familiarly in mothballs in which it is a replacement for the more traditional naphthalene. p-DCB is also used as a precursor in the production of the polymer poly(p-phenylene sulfide). Under California's Proposition 65, p-DCB is listed as known to the State to cause cancer.[8] A probable mechanism for the carcinogenic effects of mothballs and some types of air fresheners containing p-DCB has been identified.",106-46-7,4685.0,C6H4Cl2,145.96901,White powder.,52.7°C,,0.0813 mg/mL at 25°C,Inhalation (L397) ; oral (L397) ; dermal (L397) ; eye  contact (L397),"The hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity observed in laboratory animals are likely due to the formation of toxic intermediates formed while converting 1,4-DCB to 2,5-dichlorophenol by cytochrome P-450, or by depletion of GSH at higher doses of 1,4-DCB, or both. (L395)","Absorption of 1,4-DCB is rapid and essentially complete following inhalation or oral exposure. It is distributed throughout the body, preferentially to the fat tissue and organ-specific sites within the body, following the order: adipose > kidney > liver > blood. 1,4-DCB is initially metabolized by cytochrome P-450 enzymes, specifically P4502E1, to an active epoxide followed by hydrolysis to 2,5-dichlorophenol, which may be further oxidized to dichlorocatechols, or possibly a dichlorohydroquinone. More often, it might be conjugated to sulfate, or to form the glucuronide, or mercapturic acid; conjugation occurs extensively, with virtually no unconjugated metabolites reported in the available studies. Metabolism is believed to occur mainly in the liver, but may occur at lower levels in other tissues, such as the kidney or lung. 1,4-DCB is eliminated almost exclusively in the urine, primarily as conjugates of 2,5-dichlorophenol.

Recently, using 1,4-DCB to make resins has become very important.

HCCPD is used to make a group of related pesticides (aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin, endosulfan, endrin, heptachlor, isodrin, mirex, and pentac) referred to cyclodienes.

It can be postulated, that some of its toxic properties are a consequence of its reactivity in Diels-Alder reactions where a conjugated diene combines with a substituted or unsubstituted alkene (a dienophile) in a cycloaddition reaction. Biological tissues contain a large number of potential reactants for cycloaddition reactions. HCCPD can also undergo addition and substitution reactions or be oxidized by way of the mixed function oxidase system. Effects of HCCPD on the brain may also be a reflection of the reaction of either HCCPD or a metabolite with brain lipids. The effects of HCCPD on the adrenal glands may be a reflection of its ability to combine with the unsaturated carbons in sterols produced by this gland. The hydroxyl functional group of a sterol is on a carbon adjacent to the double bond and can activate that bond to cycloaddition reactions. Such reactions would require exposure to large doses of HCCPD so that reactive material would reach the adrenal gland. HCCPD is excreted in urine and feces.

Long-term exposure to very low levels of HCCPD can produce granular yellow-brown pigmentation of the epithelium of the nose, trachea, larynx, and lungs.

146.0,171.0,T3D0170,p-Cresol,"p-Cresol (4-methylphenol), a 108.1 Da volatile low-molecular-weight compound, is a phenol. It is a partially lipophilic moiety which strongly binds to plasma protein (close to 100%) under normal conditions. p-Cresol is metabolized through conjugation, mainly sulphation and glucuronization, but removal of the unconjugated p-cresol is, at least in part, via the urine. Therefore it is not surprising that this compound, together with several other phenoles, is retained when the kidneys fail. P-Cresol is an end-product of protein breakdown, and an increase of the nutritional protein load in healthy individuals results in enhanced generation and urinary excretion. The serum p-cresol concentration in uremic patients can be decreased by changing to a low-protein diet. p-Cresol is one of the metabolites of the amino acid tyrosine, and to a certain extent also of phenylalanine, which are converted to 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid by intestinal bacteria, before being decarboxylated to p-cresol (putrefaction). The main contributing bacteria are aerobes (mainly enterobacteria), but to a certain extent also anaerobes play a role (mainly Clostridium perfringens). In uremia, modifications in the intestinal flora result in the specific overgrowth of bacteria that are specific p-cresol producers. The administration of antibiotics reduces urinary excretion of p-cresol, as a result of the liquidation of the producing bacteria. Environmental factors might also contribute. The liver cytochrome P450 metabolizes toluene to benzyl alcohol, but also to o-cresol and p-cresol. Toluene is not only used industrially, but it is also the most widely abusively inhaled solvent. Furthermore, p-cresol is a metabolite of menthofuran, one of the metabolites of R-(+)-pulegone, which is found in extracts from the plants Mentha pulegium and Hedeoma pulegioides, commonly known as pennyroyal oil and pennyroyal tea. These extracts are popular as unconventional herbal therapeutic agents and are applied as abortiva, diaphoretics, emmenagogues, and psychedelic drugs. Pennyroyal oil is extensively used for its pleasant mint-like smell in the flavoring industry. The toxicity of pennyroyal oil and menthofuran is well known. Another compound used in traditional medicine, especially in Japan, which is a precursor of p-cresol is wood tar creosote. p-Cresol has been reported to affect several biochemical, biological and physiological functions: (i) it diminishes the oxygen uptake of rat cerebral cortex slices; (ii) it increases the free active drug concentration of warfarin and diazepam; (iii) it has been related to growth retardation in the weanling pig; (iv) it alters cell membrane permeability, at least in bacteria; (v) it induces LDH leakage from rat liver slices; (vi) it induces susceptibility to auditive epileptic crises; and (vii) it blocks cell K+ channels. (A7723). p-Cresol is a uremic toxin that is at least partially removed by peritoneal dialysis in haemodialysis patients, and has been involved in the progression of renal failure. (MID: 11169029). At concentrations encountered during uremia, p-cresol inhibits phagocyte function and decreases leukocyte adhesion to cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells. (A3274).",106-44-5,2879.0,C7H8O,108.05751,Colorless solids or liquids. ,35.5°C,,21.5 mg/mL at 25°C,Inhalation (L528) ; dermal (L528) ; oral (L528),"p-Cresol is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Cresols can be absorbed following inhalation, oral, and dermal exposure. Once in the body they can distribute rapidly into many organs and tissues. Cresols undergo oxidative metabolism in the liver and are rapidly eliminated, mostly in the urine, as sulfate or glucuronide conjugates. The activation of cresols by oxidation involves tyrosinase and thyroid peroxidase, forming a reactive quinone methide. Experiments with recombinant P-450s demonstrated cresol metabolism was mediated by several P-450s including CYP2D6, 2C19, 1A2, 1A1, and 2E1.

They may be formed normally in the body from other compounds. Cresols are found in many foods and in wood and tobacco smoke, crude oil, coal tar, and in chemical mixtures used as wood preservatives. Small organisms in soil and water produce cresols when they break down materials in the environment. Breathing air containing cresols is the primary source of exposure. Exposure may also result from drinking contaminated water, eating contaminated food and coming into contact with liquids containing cresols. (L528)  ","Intermediate Oral: 0.1 mg/kg/day (L134) 
Chronic Oral: 0.1 mg/kg/day (L134)","Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Ingestion of p-cresol results in burning of the mouth and throat, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Inhalation or dermal exposure of animals to p-cresol can produce irritation and corrosion at the site of contact. (L482)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

The increases in serum cholesterol that are sometimes seen following carbon disulfide exposure may be a result of increased hepatic cholesterol synthesis. The primary target of carbon disulfide appears to be the nervous system. Neurophysiological and behavioral effects as well as pathomorphology of peripheral nervous system structures have been reported in humans. Moreover, carbon disulfide metabolites of the thiocarbamate type inhibit aldehyde anhydrase. (L592, A215)","Nitrogenase reduces carbon disulfide and can also be inhibited by this toxin. Carbon disulfide binds (in the form of AL CS2) mainly to hemoglobin and to a small extent to other blood proteins, such as albumin and gamma-globulin. Carbon disulfide is bioactivated by cytochrome P-450 to an unstable oxygen intermediate. The intermediate may either spontaneously degrade to atomic sulfur and carbonyl sulfide or hydrolyze to form atomic sulfur and monothiocarbonate. The atomic sulfur generated in these reactions may either covalently bind to macromolecules or be oxidized to products such as sulfate. The carbonyl sulfide formed may be converted to monothiocarbonate by carbonic anhydrase. Monothiocarbonate may further spontaneously degrade, regenerating carbonyl sulfide or forming carbon dioxide and sulfide bisulfide ion (HS-). The HS- formed can subsequently be oxidized to sulfate or other nonvolatile metabolites. Dithiocarbamates are the products of the reaction of carbon disulfide with amino acids. Most of the carbon disulfude absorbed is metabolized. Small traces of unchanged can be found in the urine. Carbon disulfide or carbonyl sulfide can conjugate with endogenous glutathione to yield thiazolidine-2-thione-4-carboxylic acid and 2-oxythiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid, respectively. Carbonic anhydrase 2 mediates the metabolism of carbon disulfide.

Patients can developed normochromic and normocytic anemia, eosinopenia, and an increase in reticulocyte cell numbers after oral exposure . Carbon disulfide poisoning can result in central nervous system depression, coma, respiratory paralysis, and death. It also may accelerate coronary artery disease. Peripheral neuropathies, cranial nerve dysfunction, and neuropsychiatric changes are present in over 70% of chronic carbon sulfide victims. (L592)","Dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath, vomiting, weakness, irritability and hallucination can result from inhalation, ingestion or skin exposure to carbon disultfide. Skin and eye exposure can lead to pain, redness. Moreover, dermal exposure can lead to dryness of the skin; the carbon disulfide may be absorbed. Weak pulse, palpitations, fatigue, weakness in the legs, unsteady gait, vertigo, hyperesthesia, agitation, mania, hallucinations of sight, hearing, taste, and smell in acute are other symtoms of carbon disulfide poisoning. (L593, T28)","Following oral exposure, administer charcoal as a slurry (240 mL water/30 g charcoal). Consider gastric lavage after ingestion of a potentially life-threatening amount of poison if it can be performed soon after ingestion (generally within 1 hour). Intravenous urea (0.5 to 1.5 g/kg) has been recommended to inactivate free carbon disulfide in the blood. The efficacy of this treatment is unknown. Following inhalation exposure, move patient to fresh air. Monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids.

Thus the poisons uncouple phosphorylation from oxidation. Free energy from the electron transport chain then converts to more body heat. As body temp rises, heat-dissipating mechanisms are overcome and metabolism is speeded. More ADP and other substrates accumulate, and these substrates stimulate the electron transport chain further. The electron transport chain responds by using up more and more available oxygen (increasing oxygen demand) in an effort to produce ATP, but much of the free energy generated is liberated as still more body heat. Oxygen demand quickly overcomes oxygen supply, and energy reserves become depleted.

155.0,183.0,T3D0182,Phenol,"Phenol, is a toxic, colourless crystalline solid with a sweet tarry odor that resembles a hospital smell. It is commonly used as an antiseptic and disinfectant. It is active against a wide range of micro-organisms including some fungi and viruses, but is only slowly effective against spores. It has been used to disinfect skin and to relieve itching. Phenol is also used in the preparation of cosmetics including sunscreens, hair dyes, and skin lightening preparations. It is also used in the production of drugs (it is the starting material in the industrial production of aspirin), weedkillers, and synthetic resins. Phenol can be found in areas with high levels of motor traffic, therefore, people living in crowded urban areas are frequently exposed to traffic-derived phenol vapor. The average (mean +/- SD) phenol concentration in urine among normal individuals living in urban areas is 7.4 +/- 2.2 mg/g of creatinine. Exposure of the skin to concentrated phenol solutions causes chemical burns which may be severe; in laboratories where it is used, it is usually recommended that polyethylene glycol solution is kept available for washing off splashes. Notwithstanding the effects of concentrated solutions, it is also used in cosmetic surgery as an exfoliant, to remove layers of dead skin (Wikipedia). In some bacteria phenol can be directly synthesized from tyrosine via the enzyme tyrosine phenol-lyase [EC:4.1.99.2].",108-95-2,996.0,C6H6O,94.04187,White powder.,40.9°C,182°C (359.6°F),"82.8 mg/mL at 25°C [SOUTHWORTH,GR & KELLER,JL (1986)]",Inhalation (L159) ; oral (L159) ; dermal (L159) ; eye  contact (L159),"Phenol is irritating and corrosive at high concentrations. Phenol impairs the stratum corneum and produces coagulation necrosis by denaturing and precipitating proteins. It is suggested that dermal application of phenol increases the formation of free radicals in the skin, and that the redox cycling of these radicals reduces antioxidant capacity, leading to significant oxidative damage of protein, DNA, and lipids. Phenol also act as a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. (A227, L624)","When it is absorbed through the lungs, gut, or skin, phenol conjugated at the portal-of-entry and free phenol enter the bloodstream where it can then be distributed throughout the body. The dilution of phenol in water enhances the dermal absorption of phenol. Three different enzymes systems catalyze the reactions that transform phenol. Cytosolic phenol sulfotransferases catalyze the transfer of inorganic sulfur from the activated 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'phosphosulfate donor molecule to the hydroxyl group on phenol. Microsomal membrane-located uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyltransferases catalyze the transfer of an activated glucuronic acid molecule to the hydroxyl moiety of phenol to form an O-glucuronide conjugate. Cytochrome P4502E1, also microsomally located, catalyzes the hydroxylation of phenol to form hydroquinone (and to a much lesser extent, catechol), which is then acted upon by the phase II enzymes. Hydroquinone can, in turn, form conjugates, undergo peroxidation to form benzoquinone, or undergo further oxidation to form trihydroxybenzene. All three enzyme systems that metabolize phenol are found in multiple tissues and there is competition among them not only for phenol, but also for subsequent oxidative products, like hydroquinone. As a consequence, the relative amount of the products formed can vary based on species, dose and route of administration. Cytochromes other than CYP2E1, such as CYP2F2 are suggested to participate in the phenol metabolism in the liver. Tyrosinase also catalyzes the oxidation of phenols. The gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung, and kidney appear to be the major sites of phenol sulfate and glucuronide conjugation of simple phenols. Phenol, in its free and conjugated forms, is a normal constituent of human urine. (L624, A223, A225, A221, A224)","LD50: 400 mg/kg/day (Oral, Rat) (L624)

Exposure may result from breathing air containing phenol and drinking contaminated water or eating food contaminated with phenol. Exposure also occurs through dermal contact with contaminated air or by skin contact with products containing phenol. Dermal contact can occur through the use of general disinfectants and ointments containing phenol. Ingestion can occur through the use of products such as throat lozenges or sore throat sprays that contain phenol.

Ingestion of liquid products containing concentrated phenol can cause serious gastrointestinal damage and even death. Application of concentrated phenol to the skin can cause severe skin damage. Longer-term exposure to high levels of phenol caused damaged to the heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs.

157.0,185.0,T3D0184,Acetone,"Acetone is one of the ketone bodies produced during ketoacidosis. Acetone is not regarded as a waste product of metabolism. However, its physiological role in biochemical machinery is not clear. A model for the role of acetone metabolism is presented that orders the events occurring in acetonemia in sequence: in diabetic ketosis or starvation, ketone body production (b-hydroxy-butyrate, acetoacetate) provides fuel for vital organs (heart, brain .) raising the chance of survival of the metabolic catastrophe. However, when ketone body production exceeds the degrading capacity, the accumulating acetoacetic acid presents a new challenge to the pH regulatory system. Acetone production and its further degradation to C3 fragments fulfill two purposes: the maintenance of pH buffering capacity and provision of fuel for peripheral tissues. Since ketosis develops under serious metabolic circumstances, all the mechanisms that balance or moderate the effects of ketosis enhance the chance for survival. From this point of view, the theory that transportable C3 fragments can serve as additional nutrients is a novel view of acetone metabolism which introduces a new approach to the study of acetone degradation, especially in understanding its physiological function and the interrelationship between liver and peripheral tissues. (A7724). Acetone is typically derived from acetoacetate through the action of microbial acetoacetate decarboxylases found in gut microflora. In chemistry, acetone is the simplest representative of the ketones. Acetone is a colorless, mobile, flammable liquid readily soluble in water, ethanol, ether, etc., and itself serves as an important solvent. Acetone is an irritant and inhalation may lead to hepatotoxic effects (causing liver damage).",67-64-1,180.0,C3H6O,58.04187,,-94.8°C,56.2°C (133.2°F),1000 mg/mL at 25°C,Inhalation (L937) ; oral (L937) ;  dermal (L937) ; eye contact (L937),"Since acetone is highly water soluble, it is readily taken up by the blood and widely distributed to body tissues. Acetone may interfere with the composition of the membranes, altering their permeability to ions. Systemically, acetone is moderately toxic to the liver and produces hematological effects. The renal toxicity may be due to the metabolite, formate, which is known to be nephrotoxic and is excreted by the kidneys. One of the major effects of acetone is the potentiation of the toxicity of other chemicals. Pretreatment with acetone has been shown to potentiate the hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of carbon tetrachloride and chloroform by inducing particular forms of cytochrome P-450, especially cytochrome P-45OIIE1, and associated enzyme activities. (N004)","The metabolic fate of acetone is independent of route of administration and involves three separate gluconeogenic pathways, with ultimate incorporation of carbon atoms into glucose and other products and substrates of intermediary metabolism with generation of carbon dioxide. The primary (major) pathway involves hepatic metabolism of acetone to acetol and hepatic metabolism of acetol to methylglyoxal, while two secondary (minor) pathways are partially extrahepatic, involving the extrahepatic reduction of acetol to L-1,2-propanediol. Subsequent conversion of acetol to methylglyoxal in microsomes is catalyzed by acetol monooxygenase (also called acetol hydroxylase), an activity also associated with cytochrome P-450IIE1, and also requires oxygen and NADPH. Methylglyoxal can then be converted to D-glucose by an unidentified pathway, and/or possibly by catalysis by glyoxalase I and II and glutathione to D-lactate, which is converted to D-glucose. Some of exogenous acetone is unmetabolized and is excreted primarily in the expired air with little acetone excreted in urine.

(L135),"Most acetone produced is used to make other chemicals that make plastics, fibers, and drugs. Acetone is also used to dissolve other substances.

(N004, A578)","Sore throat, cough, confusion, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and unconsciousness are some signs observed after acetone poisoning. Moreover, ingestion of the product can cause nausea and vomiting. Redness, pain, blurred vision as well as corneal damage can result from eye exposure. A dry skin can be the result of dermal contact. Irritation of the nose, throat, lungs, and eyes can also occur depending on the route of exposure. (L937)","Following oral exposure to acetone, consider insertion of a nasogastric tube to aspirate stomach contents only after recent, large acetone ingestions; symptomatic and supportive treatment is generally all that is required. Following inhalation exposure, move patient to fresh air. Monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids. Irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes in case of eye exposure to acetone.

174.0,215.0,T3D0214,Silver,"Silver is widely distributed in the earth's crust and is found in soil, fresh and sea water, and the air. It is readily absorbed into the human body with food and drink and through inhalation, but the low levels of silver commonly present in the bloodstream (< 2.3 b.mu g/L) and in key tissues like liver and kidney have not been associated with any disease or disability. Silver is not an acknowledged trace element in the human body and fulfills no physiological or biochemical role in any tissue even though it interacts with several essential elements including zinc and calcium. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Silver has a long history in the treatment of human diseases, including epilepsy, neonatal eye disease, venereal diseases, and wound infections. It has been employed in water purification and is currently used to safeguard hospital hot water systems against Legionella infections. Principle routes of human exposure to silver nowadays are through its widespread use as an antimicrobial agent in wound care products and medical devices, including in-dwelling catheters, bone cements, cardiac valves and prostheses, orthopedic pins, and dental devices. In each case, the antimicrobial properties of silver are dependent upon release of biologically active silver ion (Ag*) from metallic silver (including nanocrystalline forms), silver nitrate, silver sulfadiazine, and other silver compounds incorporated in the various devices, and its lethal effect on pathogenic organisms. Experience has shown that a large proportion of the silver ion released from medical devices not required for antimicrobial action is disseminated into tissue fluids and exudates, where it combines with albumins and macroglobulins. These silver-protein complexes are absorbed into the systemic circulation to be deposited in key soft tissues, including the skin, liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and brain. As a xenobiotic material, silver must be presumed to present a health risk to exposed persons under some circumstances. Unlike the well-documented neurotoxic metals including lead and mercury, silver does not appear to be a cumulative poison and is eliminated from the body through the urine and feces. Excretion of silver by these routes may be a measure of mean daily intake, but since this view is based largely on the clinical use of silver nitrate and silver sulfadiazine used in burn wound therapy, its true relevance in the metabolism of silver used in the wider context of medical devices is questionable. Argyria is the most widely publicized clinical condition associated with silver accumulation in blood and soft tissues. It commonly occurs in individuals exposed to high levels of silver occupationally (metallurgy, photography, and mining industries), or consuming or inhaling silver hygiene products (including colloidal silver products) for long periods. Silver is absorbed into the body and deposited in the perivascular regions of the skin and other soft tissues as black granules of silver sulfide or silver selenide. The resulting slate grey discoloration of the skin occasionally associated with melanogenic changes, is semipermanent and cosmetically undesirable but is not known to be life-threatening.

(1985A)]",Oral (L159) ; inhalation (L159) ; dermal (L159) ; eye (L159),"2,4,5-Trichlorophenol is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","2,4,5-TCP can be metabolized to 3,4,6-trichlorocatechol, 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone, and a dihydroxydichlorobenzene.

Dermal and eye contact with the toxin are also sources of exposure (L159).",Intermediate Oral: 0.003 mg/kg/day (A234),"Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Inhalation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol may cause coughing and sore throat. Eye or skin contact causes redness and pain at the site of contact. Convulsions, diarrhoea, dizziness, headache, shortness of breath, vomiting, weakness, and ataxia may occur after ingestion (L159). ","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

181.0,224.0,T3D0223,Arsenate,"The arsenate ion is AsO43&#8722. An arsenate (compound) is any compound that contains this ion.The arsenic atom in arsenate has a valency of 5 and is also known as pentavalent arsenic or As[V].Arsenate resembles phosphate in many respects, since arsenic and phosphorus occur in the same group (column) of the periodic table. In acidic conditions arsenate exists as arsenic acid, H3AsO4;in weakly acid conditions it exists as dihydrogen arsenate ion, H2AsO4&#8722;; in weakly basic conditions it exists as hydrogen arsenate ion HAsO42&#8722;; and finally, in basic conditions, it exists as the arsenate ion AsO43&#8722. Arsenate can replace inorganic phosphate in the step of glycolysis that produces 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, yielding 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate instead. This molecule is unstable and quickly hydrolyzes, forming the next intermediate in the pathway, 3-phosphoglycerate. Therefore glycolysis proceeds, but the ATP molecule that would be generated from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is lost - arsenate is an uncoupler of glycolysis, explaining its toxicity.[1]. Some species of bacteria obtain their energy by oxidizing various fuels while reducing arsenates to form arsenites. The enzymes involved are known as arsenate reductases. In 2008, bacteria were discovered that employ a version of photosynthesis with arsenites as electron donors, producing arsenates (just like ordinary photosynthesis uses water as electron donor, producing molecular oxygen). The researchers conjectured that historically these photosynthesizing organisms produced the arsenates that allowed the arsenate-reducing bacteria to thrive. (Wikipedia). Arsenic acid is the chemical compound with the formula H3AsO4. More descriptively written as AsO(OH)3, this colorless acid is the arsenic analogue of phosphoric acid. Arsenate and phosphate salts behave very similarly. Arsenic acid as such has not been isolated, but only found in solution where it is largely ionized.

At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase. By competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Arsenic's carginogenicity is influenced by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. The binding of other arsenic protein targets may also cause altered DNA repair enzyme activity, altered DNA methylation patterns and cell proliferation. (T1, A17)","Arsenic is mainly absorbed by inhalation or ingestion, and to a lesser extent by dermal exposure. It is then distributed throughout the body, where it is reduced into arsenite, then methylated into monomethylarsenic (MMA) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) by arsenite methyltransferase. Arsenic and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Arsenic is known to induce the metal-binding protein metallothionein, which decreases the toxic effects of arsenic and other metals by binding them and making them biologically inactive, as well as acting as an antioxidant.

Arsenic trioxide causes morphological changes and DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in NB4 human promyelocytic leukemia cells <i>in vitro</i>. Arsenic trioxide also causes damage or degradation of the fusion protein PML/RAR-alpha. It is suspected that arsenic trioxide induces cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. Arsenic and its metabolites disrupt ATP production through several mechanisms. At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and by competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Arsenic's carginogenicity is influenced by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. The binding of other arsenic protein targets may also cause altered DNA repair enzyme activity, altered DNA methylation patterns and cell proliferation. (T1, A17)","Arsenic is mainly absorbed by inhalation or ingestion, and to a lesser extent by dermal exposure. It is then distributed throughout the body, where it is reduced into arsenite if necessary, then methylated into monomethylarsenic (MMA) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) by arsenite methyltransferase. Arsenic and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Arsenic is known to induce the metal-binding protein metallothionein, which decreases the toxic effects of arsenic and other metals by binding them and making them biologically inactive, as well as acting as an antioxidant. (L20) The metabolism of arsenic trioxide involves reduction of pentavalent arsenic to trivalent arsenic by arsenate reductase and methylation of trivalent arsenic to monomethylarsonic acid and monomethylarsonic acid to dimethylarsinic acid by methyltransferases. The main site of methylation reactions appears to be the liver. Arsenic is stored mainly in liver, kidney, heart, lung, hair and nails.Route of Elimination: Trivalent arsenic is mostly methylated in humans and excreted in urine.","LD50: 871 mg/kg (Intraperitoneal, Rat) (T14)

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Metabolism of organophosphates occurs principally by oxidation, by hydrolysis via esterases and by reaction with glutathione. Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.","LD50: 56.2 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L1195)

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Early symptoms of poisoning may include excessive sweating, headache, weakness, giddiness, nausea, vomiting, hypersalivation, stomach pains, blurred vision, slurred speech and muscle twitching.

Through alterations in intracellular thiol status, mercury can promote oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and changes in heme metabolism. Mercury is known to bind to microsomal and mitochondrial enzymes, resulting in cell injury and death. For example, mercury is known to inhibit aquaporins, halting water flow across the cell membrane. It also inhibits the protein LCK, which causes decreased T-cell signalling and immune system depression. Mercury is also believed to inhibit neuronal excitability by acting on the postsynaptic neuronal membrane. It also affects the nervous system by inhibiting protein kinase C and alkaline phosphatase, which impairs brain microvascular formation and function, as well as alters the blood-brain barrier. Mercury also produces an autoimmune response, likely by modification of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, self peptides, T-cell receptors, or cell-surface adhesion molecules.

196.0,245.0,T3D0244,Formaldehyde,"Formaldehyde is a highly reactive aldehyde gas formed by oxidation or incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. In solution, it has a wide range of uses: in the manufacture of resins and textiles, as a disinfectant, and as a laboratory fixative or preservative. Formaldehyde solution (formalin) is considered a hazardous compound, and its vapor toxic. (From Reynolds, Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p717) -- Pubchem; The chemical compound formaldehyde (also known as methanal), is a gas with a pungent smell. It is the simplest aldehyde. Its chemical formula is H2CO. Formaldehyde was first synthesized by the Russian chemist Aleksandr Butlerov in 1859 but was conclusively identified by August Wilhelm van Hofmann in 1867. Although formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, it is readily soluble in water, and it is most commonly sold as a 37% solution in water called by trade names such as formalin or formol. In water, formaldehyde polymerizes, and formalin actually contains very little formaldehyde in the form of H2CO monomer. Usually, these solutions contain a few percent methanol to limit the extent of polymerization. Formaldehyde exhibits most of the general chemical properties of the aldehydes, except that is generally more reactive than other aldehydes. Formaldehyde is a potent electrophile. It can participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions with aromatic compounds and can undergo electrophilic addition reactions with alkenes. In the presence of basic catalysts, formaldehyde undergoes a Cannizaro reaction to produce formic acid and methanol. Because formaldehyde resins are used in many construction materials, including plywood, carpet, and spray-on insulating foams, and because these resins slowly give off formaldehyde over time, formaldehyde is one of the more common indoor air pollutants. At concentrations above 0.1 mg/kg in air, inhaled formaldehyde can irritate the eyes and mucous membranes, resulting in watery eyes, headache, a burning sensation in the throat, and difficulty breathing. -- Wikipedia.",50-00-0,712.0,CH2O,30.01056,,-92°C,,"400 mg/mL at 20°C [PICKRELL,JA et al.

Formaldehyde is known to form cross links between protein and DNA and undergo metabolic incorporation into macromolecules (DNA, RNA, and proteins). (L962)","Formaldehyde may be absorbed following inhalation, oral, or dermal exposure. It is an essential metabolic intermediate in all cells and is produced during the normal metabolism of serine, glycine, methionine, and choline and also by the demethylation of N-, S-, and O-methyl compounds. Exogenous formaldehyde is metabolized to formate by the enzyme formaldehyde dehydrogenase at the initial site of contact. After oxidation of formaldehyde to formate, the carbon atom is further oxidized to carbon dioxide or incorporated into purines, thymidine, and amino acids via tetrahydrofolatedependent one-carbon biosynthetic pathways. Formaldehyde is not stored in the body and is excreted in the urine (primarily as formic acid), incorporated into other cellular molecules, or exhaled as carbon dioxide.

Its health effects include hepatotoxicity and male reproductoxicity, possibly linked with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations including mtDNA common deletion (delta-mtDNA4977) and mtDNA copy number; during the biotransformation of DMF in the body, free radicals are formed, including hydroxyl radicals. The world-wide consumption of DMF in 2001 was approximately 285,000 metric tonnes and most of that was used as an industrial solvent. Overexposure to DMF could result in hepatotoxicity, alcohol intolerance, possible embryotoxicity and teratogenicity in humans and animals, and decline of human sperm motility. Based on its wide application and a wide range of toxic effects, DMF has been selected as one of the four priority compounds for human field studies by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). The current permissible exposure limit for DMF in the working environment is 10 ppm in both USA and Taiwan. The concentrations of two major DMF metabolites in urine, N-methylformamide (U-NMF) of 15 mg/L and N-acetyl-S-(N-methylcarbamoyl) cysteine (U-AMCC) of 40 mg/L, were recommended as the biological exposure indices (BEIs) by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists for DMF exposure in workplace.

207.0,262.0,T3D0261,"2,6-Dinitrotoluene","2,6-Dinitrotoluene is one of the six dinitrotoluene isomers. Dinitrotoluene (DNT) or Dinitro is an explosive with the formula C6H3(CH3)(NO2)2. At room temperature it is a pale yellow to orange crystalline solid. It is a high explosive and one of the precursors for trinitrotoluene (TNT), which is synthesized through three separate nitrations of toluene. The first product is mononitrotoluene, DNT is the second, and TNT is the third and final product.

High levels of methemoglobin are removed by catabolism, leading to the development of anemia. Some metabolites of dinitrotoluene  are also transported back from the bile to the liver, where the amine group is N-hydroxylated by cytochrome P-450 to form an unstable sulfate conjugate. The sulfate conjugate is degraded into carbonium or nitrenium ions. These ions covalently bind to hepatic macromolecules (DNA, RNA), leading to mutations and subsequently liver tumors. They also bind to DNA of the lung and the intestine. (L276)","The metabolism of 2,6-DNT occurs in the liver and also in the intestine by microflora. Both oxidized and reduced metabolites are excreted in the urine after oral administration of the compound. Oxidative metabolism by cytochrome P450 predominates in the liver, leading to the formation of dinitrobenzyl alcohol which is either converted to glucuronide conjugate or further oxidized to dinitrobenzoic acid. Dinitrobenzyl alcohol glucuronide is partially excreted into the bile, followed by metabolism by gut microflora and enterohepatic cycling (nitroreductase). Thus, 2,6-DNT appears to be first metabolized by the liver with the metabolites being excreted into the bile; the biliary metabolites are hydrolyzed and further metabolized in the intestine; after reabsorption and circulation back to the liver, a portion of the metabolites (2-amino-6-nitrobenzyl) are oxidized to a hydroxylamine by hepatic enzymes. The hydroxylamine is then conjugated with sulfate by hepatic sulfotransferase. The unstable N-sulfate decomposes to form an electrophilic nitrenium ion, which can react with cellular nucleophiles such as DNA. 2,6-Dinitrobenzyl alcohol glucuronide, 2-amino-6-nitrotoluene, and 2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde can be detected in the bile. Some amounts of 2,6-dinitrobenzylalcohol and 2-amino-6nitrobenzyl alcohol can also be found. (L276)","LD50: 180-795 mg/kg/day (Oral, Rat) (L276)",,"2B, possibly carcinogenic to humans.

In its natural form it is considered non-toxic due to its low solubility, however in its crystalline form it tends to oxidize into arsenic trioxide. In addition, commercial orpiment often contains substantial amounts of arsenic oxides.  Arsenic is a chemical element that has the symbol As and atomic number 33. It is a poisonous metalloid that has many allotropic forms: yellow (molecular non-metallic) and several black and grey forms (metalloids) are a few that are seen. Three metalloidal forms of arsenic with different crystal structures are found free in nature (the minerals arsenopyrite and the much rarer arsenolamprite and pararsenolamprite), but it is more commonly found as a compound with other elements.

At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and by competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Arsenic's carginogenicity is influenced by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. The binding of other arsenic protein targets may also cause altered DNA repair enzyme activity, altered DNA methylation patterns and cell proliferation. (T1, A17)","Arsenic is absorbed mainly by inhalation or ingestion, as to a lesser extent, dermal exposure. It is then distributed throughout the body, where it is reduced into arsenite if necessary, then methylated into monomethylarsenic (MMA) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) by arsenite methyltransferase. Arsenic and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine.

Copper hepatotoxicity is believed to occur when the lysosomes become saturated and copper accumulates in the nucleus, causing nuclear damage. This damage is possibly a result of oxidative damage, including lipid peroxidation. Copper inhibits the sulfhydryl group enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and paraoxonases, which protect the cell from free oxygen radicals. It also influences gene expression and is a co-factor for oxidative enzymes such as cytochrome C oxidase and lysyl oxidase. In addition, the oxidative stress induced by copper is thought to activate acid sphingomyelinase, which lead to the production of ceramide, an apoptotic signal, as well as cause hemolytic anemia. Copper-induced emesis results from stimulation of the vagus nerve. Arsenic and its metabolites disrupt ATP production through several mechanisms.

It passes through the basolateral membrane, possibly via regulatory copper transporters, and is transported to the liver and kidney bound to serum albumin. The liver is the critical organ for copper homoeostasis. In the liver and other tissues, copper is stored bound to metallothionein, amino acids, and in association with copper-dependent enzymes, then partitioned for excretion through the bile or incorporation into intra- and extracellular proteins. The transport of copper to the peripheral tissues is accomplished through the plasma attached to serum albumin, ceruloplasmin or low-molecular-weight complexes. Copper may induce the production of metallothionein and ceruloplasmin. The membrane-bound copper transporting adenosine triphosphatase (Cu-ATPase) transports copper ions into and out of cells. Physiologically normal levels of copper in the body are held constant by alterations in the rate and amount of copper absorption, compartmental distribution, and excretion.

Copper hepatotoxicity is believed to occur when the lysosomes become saturated and copper accumulates in the nucleus, causing nuclear damage. This damage is possibly a result of oxidative damage, including lipid peroxidation. Copper inhibits the sulfhydryl group enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and paraoxonases, which protect the cell from free oxygen radicals. It also influences gene expression and is a co-factor for oxidative enzymes such as cytochrome C oxidase and lysyl oxidase. In addition, the oxidative stress induced by copper is thought to activate acid sphingomyelinase, which lead to the production of ceramide, an apoptotic signal, as well as cause hemolytic anemia. Copper-induced emesis results from stimulation of the vagus nerve. Arsenic and its metabolites disrupt ATP production through several mechanisms. At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and by competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Arsenic's carginogenicity is influenced by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. The binding of other arsenic protein targets may also cause altered DNA repair enzyme activity, altered DNA methylation patterns and cell proliferation. (T1, A17, L277, T49, A174, L280)","Copper is mainly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, but it can also be inhalated and absorbed dermally. It passes through the basolateral membrane, possibly via regulatory copper transporters, and is transported to the liver and kidney bound to serum albumin. The liver is the critical organ for copper homoeostasis. In the liver and other tissues, copper is stored bound to metallothionein, amino acids, and in association with copper-dependent enzymes, then partitioned for excretion through the bile or incorporation into intra- and extracellular proteins. The transport of copper to the peripheral tissues is accomplished through the plasma attached to serum albumin, ceruloplasmin or low-molecular-weight complexes. Copper may induce the production of metallothionein and ceruloplasmin. The membrane-bound copper transporting adenosine triphosphatase (Cu-ATPase) transports copper ions into and out of cells. Physiologically normal levels of copper in the body are held constant by alterations in the rate and amount of copper absorption, compartmental distribution, and excretion. Arsenic is absorbed mainly by inhalation or ingestion, as to a lesser extent, dermal exposure. It is then distributed throughout the body, where it is reduced into arsenite if necessary, then methylated into monomethylarsenic (MMA) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) by arsenite methyltransferase. Arsenic and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Arsenic is known to induce the metal-binding protein metallothionein, which decreases the toxic effects of arsenic and other metals by binding them and making them biologically inactive, as well as acting as an antioxidant.

226.0,297.0,T3D0296,Lead arsenate,"Lead arsenate is a chemical compound of lead and arsenic. It is derived from arsenic acid and originally used as an insecticide against the codling moth and potato beetle. Today its use is officially banned. Arsenic is a chemical element that has the symbol As and atomic number 33. It is a poisonous metalloid that has many allotropic forms: yellow (molecular non-metallic) and several black and grey forms (metalloids) are a few that are seen. Three metalloidal forms of arsenic with different crystal structures are found free in nature (the minerals arsenopyrite and the much rarer arsenolamprite and pararsenolamprite), but it is more commonly found as a compound with other elements. (T3, L383)",7784-40-9,24572.0,AsHO4Pb,347.88572,White crystals.,,,,Oral (L2) ; inhalation (L2);  dermal (L2),"Arsenic and its metabolites disrupt ATP production through several mechanisms. At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and by competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Arsenic's carginogenicity is influenced by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. The binding of other arsenic protein targets may also cause altered DNA repair enzyme activity, altered DNA methylation patterns and cell proliferation. Lead mimics other biologically important metals, such as zinc, calcium, and iron, competing as cofactors for many of their respective enzymatic reactions. For example, lead has been shown to competitively inhibit calcium's binding of calmodulin, interferring with neurotransmitter release. It exhibits similar competitive inhibition at the NMDA receptor and protein kinase C, which impairs brain microvascular formation and function, as well as alters the blood-brain barrier. Lead also affects the nervous system by impairing regulation of dopamine synthesis and blocking evoked release of acetylcholine. However, it's main mechanism of action occurs by inhibiting delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, an enzyme vital in the biosynthesis of heme, which is a necesssary cofactor of hemoglobin. (T1, T4, A17, A20, A22, L136)","Lead and arsenic are absorbed following inhalation, oral, and dermal exposure. Arsenic is then distributed throughout the body, where it is reduced into arsenite if necessary, then methylated into monomethylarsenic (MMA) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) by arsenite methyltransferase. Arsenic and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Arsenic is known to induce the metal-binding protein metallothionein, which decreases the toxic effects of arsenic and other metals by binding them and making them biologically inactive, as well as acting as an antioxidant.  Lead is distributed mainly to the bones and red blood cells. In the blood lead may be found bound to serum albumin or the metal-binding protein metallothionein. Organic lead is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 enzymes, whereas inorganic lead forms complexes with delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase. Lead is excreted mainly in the urine and faeces.

Hexavalent chromium refers to chemical compounds that contain the element chromium in the +6 oxidation state. Chromium(VI) is more toxic than other oxidation states of the chromium atom because of its greater ability to enter cells and higher redox potential.

However, its main mechanism of action occurs by inhibiting delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, an enzyme vital in the biosynthesis of heme, which is a necesssary cofactor of hemoglobin. Hexavalent chromium's carcinogenic effects are caused by its metabolites, pentavalent and trivalent chromium. The DNA damage may be caused by hydroxyl radicals produced during reoxidation of pentavalent chromium by hydrogen peroxide molecules present in the cell. Trivalent chromium may also form complexes with peptides, proteins, and DNA, resulting in DNA-protein crosslinks, DNA strand breaks, DNA-DNA interstrand crosslinks, chromium-DNA adducts, chromosomal aberrations and alterations in cellular signaling pathways. It has been shown to induce carcinogenesis by overstimulating cellular regulatory pathways and increasing peroxide levels by activating certain mitogen-activated protein kinases. It can also cause transcriptional repression by cross-linking histone deacetylase 1-DNA methyltransferase 1 complexes to CYP1A1 promoter chromatin, inhibiting histone modification. Chromium may increase its own toxicity by modifying metal regulatory transcription factor 1, causing the inhibition of zinc-induced metallothionein transcription.

Chromium distributes to nearly all tissues, with the highest concentrations found in kidney and liver. Bone is also a major storage site and may contribute to long-term retention. Hexavalent chromium's similarity to sulfate and chromate allow it to be transported into cells via sulfate transport mechanisms.

It exhibits similar competitive inhibition at the NMDA receptor and protein kinase C, which impairs brain microvascular formation and function, as well as alters the blood-brain barrier. Lead also affects the nervous system by impairing regulation of dopamine synthesis and blocking evoked release of acetylcholine. However, it's main mechanism of action occurs by inhibiting delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, an enzyme vital in the biosynthesis of heme, which is a necesssary cofactor of hemoglobin.

Through alterations in intracellular thiol status, mercury can promote oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and changes in heme metabolism. Mercury is known to bind to microsomal and mitochondrial enzymes, resulting in cell injury and death. For example, mercury is known to inhibit aquaporins, halting water flow across the cell membrane. It also inhibits the protein LCK, which causes decreased T-cell signalling and immune system depression. Mercury is also believed to inhibit neuronal excitability by acting on the postsynaptic neuronal membrane. It also affects the nervous system by inhibiting protein kinase C and alkaline phosphatase, which impairs brain microvascular formation and function, as well as alters the blood-brain barrier. Mercury also produces an autoimmune response, likely by modification of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, self peptides, T-cell receptors, or cell-surface adhesion molecules.

Through alterations in intracellular thiol status, mercury can promote oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and changes in heme metabolism. Mercury is known to bind to microsomal and mitochondrial enzymes, resulting in cell injury and death. For example, mercury is known to inhibit aquaporins, halting water flow across the cell membrane. It also inhibits the protein LCK, which causes decreased T-cell signalling and immune system depression. Mercury is also believed to inhibit neuronal excitability by acting on the postsynaptic neuronal membrane. It also affects the nervous system by inhibiting protein kinase C and alkaline phosphatase, which impairs brain microvascular formation and function, as well as alters the blood-brain barrier.

Cadmium causes cell apoptosis by activating mitogen-activated protein kinases. Bromine is a powerful oxidizing agent and is able to release oxygen free radicals from the water in mucous membranes. These free radicals are also potent oxidizers and produce tissue damage. In additon, the formation of hydrobromic and bromic acids will result in secondary irritation. The bromide ion is also known to affect the central nervous system, causing bromism. This is believed to be a result of bromide ions substituting for chloride ions in the in actions of neurotransmitters and transport systems, thus affecting numerous synaptic processes.

Toxic effects are observed once the concentration of cadmium exceeds that of available metallothionein, and it has also been shown that the cadmium-metallothionein complex may be damaging. Accumulation of cadmium in the kidney results in increased excretion of vital low and high weight molecular proteins. Cadmium is a high affinity zinc analog and can interfere in its biological processes. It also binds to and activates the estrogen receptor, likely stimulating the growth of certain types of cancer cells and causing other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. Cadmium causes cell apoptosis by activating mitogen-activated protein kinases. (L8, A18, A19, A28)","Cadmium is absorbed from oral, inhalation, and dermal routes.

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

DDT reduces potassium transport across the membrane. DDT alters the porous channels through which sodium ions pass. These channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization. DDT inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. DDT also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron.

531.0,635.0,T3D0634,Quinoline,"Quinoline is found in alcoholic beverages. Quinoline is an alkaloid from various plant species including Mentha species. Also present in cocoa, black tea and scotch whiskey. Quinoline is a flavouring ingredient Quinoline is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound. It has the formula C9H7N and is a colourless hygroscopic liquid with a strong odour. Aged samples, if exposed to light, become yellow and later brown. Quinoline is only slightly soluble in cold water but dissolves readily in hot water and most organic solvents. Quinoline is mainly used as a building block to other specialty chemicals. Approximately 4 tonnes are produced annually according to a report published in 2005.[citation needed] Its principal use is as a precursor to 8-hydroxyquinoline, which is a versatile chelating agent and precursor to pesticides. Its 2- and 4-methyl derivatives are precursors to cyanine dyes. Oxidation of quinoline affords quinolinic acid (pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid), a precursor to the herbicide sold under the name Assert.

Quinoline has been shown to exhibit catabolic, anti-microbial, anti-tumor, anti-fungal and anti-cancer functions (A7755, A7756, A7757, A7759, A7760).",91-22-5,7047.0,C9H7N,129.05785,Colorless solid.,-15.6°C,238°C (460.4°F),6.11 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L10) ; inhalation (L10),"The ability of PAH's to bind to blood proteins such as albumin allows them to be transported throughout the body.

These enzymes metabolize PAH's into their toxic intermediates.

Cobalt has also been shown to block inorganic calcium channels, possibly impairing neurotransmission. Cobalt can also chelate lipoic acids, impairing oxidation of pyruvate or fatty acids. In addition, cobalt may inhibit DNA repair by interacting with zinc finger DNA repair proteins, and has also been shown to inhibit heme synthesis and glucose metabolism. Cobalt may activate specific helper T-lymphocyte cells and interact directly with immunologic proteins, such as antibodies (IgA and IgE) or Fc receptors, resulting in immunosensitization.

579.0,685.0,T3D0684,Nickel acetate,"Nickel acetate is a chemical compound of nickel. Nickel is a chemical compound with the atomic number 28. It is found abundantly in nature in laterite ore minerals, such as limonite, garnierite, and pentlandite. Nickel has a biological role and is found in certain enzymes, including urease, hydrogenase, methylcoenzyme M reductase, and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. (L40, L41)",373-02-4,9756.0,C4H14NiO8,60.02113,Green solid.,16.6°C,,166 mg/mL [MERCK INDEX (1996)],Inhalation  (L41) ; oral (L41) ; dermal (L41),"Nickel is known to substitute for other essential elements in certain enzmes, such as calcineurin. It is genotoxic, and some nickel compounds have been shown to promote cell proliferation. Nickel has a high affinity for chromatin proteins, particularly histones and protamines. The complexing of nickel ions with heterochromatin results in a number of alterations including condensation, DNA hypermethylation, gene silencing, and inhibition of histone acetylation, which have been shown to disturb gene expression. Nickel has also been shown to alter several transcription factors, including hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, activating transcription factor, and NF-KB transcription factor. There is also evidence that nickel ions inhibit DNA repair, either by directly inhibiting DNA repair enzymes or competing with zinc ions for binding to zinc-finger DNA binding proteins, resulting in structural changes in DNA that prevent repair enzymes from binding. Nickel ions can also complex with a number of cellular ligands including amino acids, peptides, and proteins resulting in the generation of oxygen radicals, which induce base damage, DNA strand breaks, and DNA protein crosslinks. (L41, A40)","Nickel is absorbed mainly through the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Once in the body it enters the bloodstream, where it binds to albumin, L-histidine, and _2-macroglobulin. Nickel tends to accumulate in the lungs, thyroid, kidney, heart, and liver. Absorbed nickel is excreted in the urine, wherease unabsorbed nickel is excreted in the faeces.

Intermediate Oral: 0.01 mg/kg/day (L134) ","The most common harmful health effect of nickel in humans is an allergic reaction. This usually manifests as a skin rash, although some people experience asthma attacks. Long term inhahation of nickel causes chronic bronchitis and reduced lung function, as well as damage to the naval cavity. Ingestion of excess nickel results in damage to the stomach, blood, liver, kidneys, and immune system, as well as having adverse effects on reproduction and development. (L41)","Symptoms of nickel poisoning include headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, irritability, and difficulty sleeping, followed by chest pains, sweating, rapid heart beat, and a dry cough. (L42)",Excess exposure to nickel is usually handled by preventing further exposure and symptomatic treatment. Nickel poisoning may also be treated using chelation therapy with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. (L42),2009-03-23 00:28:30+00:00,2014-12-24 20:22:33+00:00,,,,"276100

595.0,701.0,T3D0700,Ammonium dichromate,"Ammonium dichromate is a chemical compound of hexavalent chromium. It has been used in pyrotechnics. Hexavalent chromium refers to chemical compounds that contain the element chromium in the +6 oxidation state. Chromium(VI) is more toxic than other oxidation states of the chromium atom because of its greater ability to enter cells and higher redox potential. (L16, L51)",7789-09-5,24600.0,Cr2H8N2O7,251.91417,Orange crystals.,180°C,,,Inhalation  (L16) ; oral (L16) ; dermal (L16),"Hexavalent chromium's carcinogenic effects are caused by its metabolites, pentavalent and trivalent chromium. The DNA damage may be caused by hydroxyl radicals produced during reoxidation of pentavalent chromium by hydrogen peroxide molecules present in the cell. Trivalent chromium may also form complexes with peptides, proteins, and DNA, resulting in DNA-protein crosslinks, DNA strand breaks, DNA-DNA interstrand crosslinks, chromium-DNA adducts, chromosomal aberrations and alterations in cellular signaling pathways. It has been shown to induce carcinogenesis by overstimulating cellular regulatory pathways and increasing peroxide levels by activating certain mitogen-activated protein kinases. It can also cause transcriptional repression by cross-linking histone deacetylase 1-DNA methyltransferase 1 complexes to CYP1A1 promoter chromatin, inhibiting histone modification. Chromium may increase its own toxicity by modifying metal regulatory transcription factor 1, causing the inhibition of zinc-induced metallothionein transcription. (A12, L16, A34, A35, A36)","Chromium is absorbed from oral, inhalation, or dermal exposure and distributes to nearly all tissues, with the highest concentrations found in kidney and liver. Bone is also a major storage site and may contribute to long-term retention.

Stomach acid dissolves metallic zinc to give corrosive zinc chloride, which can cause damage to the stomach lining. Metal fume fever is thought to be an immune response to inhaled zinc. Nitrate's toxicity is a result of it's conversion to nitrite once in the body. Nitrite causes the autocatalytic oxidation of oxyhemoglobin to hydrogen peroxide and methemoglobin. This elevation of methemoglobin levels is a condition known as methemoglobinemia, and is characterized by tissue hypoxia, as methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen. (A2450, L1613, L48, L49, A49)","Zinc can enter the body through the lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Intestinal absorption of zinc is controlled by zinc carrier protein CRIP. Zinc also binds to metallothioneins, which help prevent absorption of excess zinc. Zinc is widely distributed and found in all tissues and tissues fluids, concentrating in the liver, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, skin, lung, brain, heart, and pancreas. In the bloodstream zinc is found bound to carbonic anhydrase in erythrocytes, as well as bound to albumin, _2-macroglobulin, and amino acids in the the plasma. Albumin and amino acid bound zinc can diffuse across tissue membranes. Zinc is excreted in the urine and faeces. Intake of some amount of nitrates and nitrites is a normal part of the nitrogen cycle in humans. In vivo conversion of nitrates to nitrites can occur in the gastrointestional tract under the right conditions, significantly enhancing nitrates' toxic potency. The major metabolic pathway for nitrate is conversion to nitrite, and then to ammonia. Nitrites, nitrates, and their metabolites are excreted in the urine. (L1137, L49)","LD50: 1400 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (A200)",,Ingested nitrate or nitrite under conditions that result in endogenous nitrosation is probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A). (L135),Zinc nitrate is used as a mordant in dyeing. (L71),"Intermediate Oral: 0.3 mg/kg/day (L134) 
Chronic Oral: 0.3 mg/kg/day (L134)","Chronic exposure to zinc causes anemia, atazia, lethargy, and decreases the level of good cholesterol in the body. It is also believed to cause pancreatic and reproductive damage. Nitrate and nitrite poisoning causes methemoglobinemia. Nitrites may cause pregnancy complications and developmental effects. They may also be carcinogenic. (L1137, L49)","Ingestion of large doses of zinc causes stomach cramps, nausea, and vomiting. Acute inhalation of large amounts of zinc causes metal fume fever, which is characterized by chills, fever, headache, weakness, dryness of the nose and throat, chest pain, and coughing. Dermal contact with zinc results in skin irritation. Nitrate and nitrite poisoning causes methemoglobinemia. Symptoms include cyanosis, cardiac dysrhythmias and circulatory failure, and progressive central nervous system (CNS) effects. CNS effects can range from mild dizziness and lethargy to coma and convulsions. (L1137, L49)","Zinc poisoning is treated symptomatically, often by administering fluids such as water or milk, or with gastric lavage. Methemoglobinemia can be treated with supplemental oxygen and methylene blue 1% solution administered intravenously slowly over five minutes followed by IV flush with normal saline. Methylene blue restores the iron in hemoglobin to its normal (reduced) oxygen-carrying state.

631.0,737.0,T3D0736,Zinc oxide,"Zinc oxide is a nutrient supplement. Zinc oxide is a constituent of cigarette filters for removal of selected components from tobacco smoke. Zinc oxide is a filter consisting of charcoal impregnated with zinc oxide and iron oxide removes significant amounts of HCN and H2S from tobacco smoke without affecting its flavor. Zinc oxide is an amphoteric oxide. It is nearly insoluble in water and alcohol, but it is soluble in (degraded by) most acids, such as hydrochloric acid:; Zinc oxide is an inorganic compound with the formula ZnO. It usually appears as a white powder, nearly insoluble in water. The powder is widely used as an additive into numerous materials and products including plastics, ceramics, glass, cement, rubber (e.g. car tyres), lubricants, paints, ointments, adhesives, sealants, pigments, foods (source of Zn nutrient), batteries, ferrites, fire retardants, first aid tapes, etc. ZnO is present in the Earth crust as a mineral zincite; however, most ZnO used commercially is produced synthetically. Zinc white is used as a pigment in paints and is more opaque than lithopone, but less opaque than titanium dioxide. It is also used in coatings for paper. Chinese white is a special grade of zinc white used in artists' pigments. Because it reflects both UVA and UVB rays of ultraviolet light, zinc oxide can be used in ointments, creams, and lotions to protect against sunburn and other damage to the skin caused by ultraviolet light (see sunscreen). It is the broadest spectrum UVA and UVB absorber that is approved for use as a sunscreen by the FDA, and is completely photostable. It is also a main ingredient of mineral makeup. ZnO is a relatively soft material with approximate hardness of 4.5 on the Mohs scale. Its elastic constants are smaller than those of relevant III-V semiconductors, such as GaN. The high heat capacity and heat conductivity, low thermal expansion and high melting temperature of ZnO are beneficial for ceramics.<br /> Zinc oxide has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and antibiotic functions (A7764, A7765).<br /> Zinc oxide belongs to the family of Transition Metal Oxides.

645.0,754.0,T3D0753,Copper(I) cyanide,"Copper(I) cyanide is a chemical compound of copper and cyanide. It was used as a catalyst in polymerizations, in electroplating of copper and iron, and as insecticide, fungicide, and biocide in marine paints. Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu and atomic number 29. Copper is an essential elements in plants and animals as it is required for the normal functioning of more than 30 enzymes. It occurs naturally throughout the environment in rocks, soil, water, and air. (L277, L278, L98)",544-92-3,2724144.0,CCuN,88.93268,White to greenish powder.,474°C,,,Inhalation  (L96) ; oral (L96) ; dermal (L96),"Excess copper is sequestered within hepatocyte lysosomes, where it is complexed with metallothionein. Copper hepatotoxicity is believed to occur when the lysosomes become saturated and copper accumulates in the nucleus, causing nuclear damage. This damage is possibly a result of oxidative damage, including lipid peroxidation. Copper inhibits the sulfhydryl group enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and paraoxonases, which protect the cell from free oxygen radicals. It also influences gene expression and is a co-factor for oxidative enzymes such as cytochrome C oxidase and lysyl oxidase. In addition, the oxidative stress induced by copper is thought to activate acid sphingomyelinase, which lead to the production of ceramide, an apoptotic signal, as well as cause hemolytic anemia. Copper-induced emesis results from stimulation of the vagus nerve. Organic nitriles decompose into cyanide ions both in vivo and in vitro. Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97, L277, T49, A174, L280)","Copper is mainly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, but it can also be inhalated and absorbed dermally. It passes through the basolateral membrane, possibly via regulatory copper transporters, and is transported to the liver and kidney bound to serum albumin. The liver is the critical organ for copper homoeostasis. In the liver and other tissues, copper is stored bound to metallothionein, amino acids, and in association with copper-dependent enzymes, then partitioned for excretion through the bile or incorporation into intra- and extracellular proteins. The transport of copper to the peripheral tissues is accomplished through the plasma attached to serum albumin, ceruloplasmin or low-molecular-weight complexes. Copper may induce the production of metallothionein and ceruloplasmin. The membrane-bound copper transporting adenosine triphosphatase (Cu-ATPase) transports copper ions into and out of cells. Physiologically normal levels of copper in the body are held constant by alterations in the rate and amount of copper absorption, compartmental distribution, and excretion. Organic nitriles are converted into cyanide ions through the action of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. Cyanide is rapidly absorbed and distributed throughout the body. Cyanide is mainly metabolized into thiocyanate by either rhodanese or 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase. Cyanide metabolites are excreted in the urine.

Very-high doses of copper can cause damage to your liver and kidneys, and can even cause death. Copper may induce allergic responses in sensitive individuals. Exposure to high levels of cyanide for a short time harms the brain and heart and can even cause coma, seizures, apnea, cardiac arrest and death. Chronic inhalation of cyanide causes breathing difficulties, chest pain, vomiting, blood changes, headaches, and enlargement of the thyroid gland. Skin contact with cyanide salts can irritate and produce sores. (L96, L97, L278, L279)","Breathing high levels of copper can cause irritation of the nose and throat.

661.0,771.0,T3D0770,Ethanol,"Ethanol is a clear, colorless liquid rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body. It has bactericidal activity and is used often as a topical disinfectant. It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in alcoholic beverages. Indeed, ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption, including scents, flavorings, colorings, and medicines. Ethanol has a depressive effect on the central nervous system and because of its psychoactive effects, it is considered a drug. Ethanol has a complex mode of action and affects multiple systems in the brain, most notably it acts as an agonist to the GABA receptors. Death from ethanol consumption is possible when blood alcohol level reaches 0.4%. A blood level of 0.5% or more is commonly fatal. Levels of even less than 0.1% can cause intoxication, with unconsciousness often occurring at 0.3-0.4 %. Ethanol is metabolized by the body as an energy-providing carbohydrate nutrient, as it metabolizes into acetyl CoA, an intermediate common with glucose metabolism, that can be used for energy in the citric acid cycle or for biosynthesis. Ethanol within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and then into acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The product of the first step of this breakdown, acetaldehyde, is more toxic than ethanol. Acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol. It has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver,[77] multiple forms of cancer, and alcoholism. Industrially, ethanol is produced both as a petrochemical, through the hydration of ethylene, and biologically, by fermenting sugars with yeast. Small amounts of ethanol are endogenously produced by gut microflora through anaerobic fermentation. However most ethanol detected in biofluids and tissues likely comes from consumption of alcoholic beverages. Absolute ethanol or anhydrous alcohol generally refers to purified ethanol, containing no more than one percent water. Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. It often contains trace amounts of toxic benzene (used to remove water by azeotropic distillation). Consumption of this form of ethanol can be fatal over a short time period. Generally absolute or pure ethanol is used as a solvent for lab and industrial settings where water will disrupt a desired reaction. Pure ethanol is classed as 200 proof in the USA and Canada, equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the UK system.",64-17-5,702.0,C2H6O,46.04187,,-114.1°C,78.2°C,1E+006 mg/L (at 25°C),"Oral, rapidly absorbed. Blood alcohol level and the time necessary to achieve it are controlled largely by the rapidity and extent of ethanol consumption. (T10)","Alcohol binds to the GABA(A) receptors (delta subunit), NMDA receptors, Glycine receptors, Serotonin receptors, Acetylcholine receptors, L-channel calcium channels and GIRK channels.  Ethanol acts in the central nervous system primarily by binding to the GABAA receptor, increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Ethanol within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol. It has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver and multiple forms of cancer. During the metabolism of alcohol via the respective dehydrogenases, NAD (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is converted into reduced NAD. Normally, NAD is used to metabolise fats in the liver, and as such alcohol competes with these fats for the use of NAD. Prolonged exposure to alcohol means that fats accumulate in the liver, leading to the term 'fatty liver'. Continued consumption (such as in alcoholism) then leads to cell death in the hepatocytes as the fat stores reduce the function of the cell to the point of death. These cells are then replaced with scar tissue, leading to the condition called cirrhosis.","Ethanol is metabolized to acetaldehyde by three enzymes:
1. Alcohol dehydrogenase metabolized methanol  to acetaldehyde, which is oxidized by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase to acetate.
2. Catalase metabolizes ethanol by utilizing H2O2 supplied by the actionhs of NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase. This normally accounts for more than 10% of ethanol metabolism.
3. CYP2E1, is the principal component of the hepatic microsomal ethanol oxidizing system, MEOS)
(T10)","LD50: 5628 mg/kg (Oral, rat) ","The fatal dose of ethanol is 300-400 mL of pure ethanol (600-800 mL of 50% spirits), for the average adult if consumed in less than one hour. More specifically, the lethal dose of alcohol is 5-8g/kg (3g/kg for children).",Ethanol in alcoholic beverages is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). (L135),"Ethanol is used as a solvent in industry, in many household products and pharmaceuticals, and in intoxicating beverages. It is also used for therapeutic neurolysis of nerves or ganglia for the relief of intractable chronic pain in such conditions as inoperable cancer and trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux), in patients for whom neurosurgical procedures are contraindicated.",,"Acute: At 0.1% blood alcohol levels individuals experience CNS depression, nausea, possible vomiting, impaired cognition and impaired motor and sensory function. Accidents or injury can also occur due to the side effects of loss of coordination, slowed reaction time, sleepiness and impaired judgment. At >0.14% blood alcohol levels there is decreased blood flow to the brain.  At greater than 0.3% blood alcohol there is a marked degree of stupefaction and possible unconsciousness.  At levels greater than 0.4% there is a risk of death.  Acute consumption leading to blood alcohol levels greater than 0.5% is almost universally fatal.
Chronic: high levels of alcohol consumption are associated with an increased risk of alcoholism, malnutrition, chronic pancreatitis, alcoholic (fatty) liver disease, and cancer.  Frequent drinking of alcoholic beverages has been shown to be a major contributing factor in cases of elevated blood levels of triglycerides. In addition, damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from chronic alcohol abuse. The long-term use of alcohol is capable of damaging nearly every organ and system in the body. The developing adolescent brain is particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of alcohol. In addition, the developing fetal brain is also vulnerable, and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) may result if pregnant mothers consume alcohol. The net effect of alcohol consumption on global human health is quite detrimental, with an estimated 3.8% of all global deaths and 4.6% of global disability-adjusted life-years attributable to alcohol.  Ethanol is considered a teratogen (causing fetal alcohol syndrome) and a Group 1 carcinogen because of the carcinogenicity of acetaldehyde (a major metabolite of alcohol).","Symptoms and effects of overdose include nausea, vomiting, CNS depression, acute respiratory failure or death and with chronic use, severe health problems, such as liver and brain damage. At >0.14% blood alcohol levels there is decreased blood flow to the brain.  At greater than 0.3% blood alcohol there is a marked degree of stupefaction and possible unconsciousness.  At levels greater than 0.4% there is a risk of death.  Acute consumption leading to blood alcohol levels greater than 0.5% is almost universally fatal. With chronic alcohol abuse, severe health problems, such as liver and brain damage can be present.","If you suspect someone has alcohol poisoning, call for an ambulance to take them to a hospital. While you're waiting: try to keep them sitting up and awake, give them water if they can drink it. If they've passed out, lie them on their side in the recovery position and check they're breathing properly, keep them warm and stay with them and monitor their symptoms. Acute alcohol poisoning is a medical emergency due to the risk of death from respiratory depression and/or inhalation of vomit if emesis occurs while the patient is unconscious and unresponsive. Emergency treatment for acute alcohol poisoning strives to stabilize the patient and maintain a patent airway and respiration, while waiting for the alcohol to metabolize.  Emergency treatment in a hospital can involve: 1) treating hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) with 50 ml of 50% dextrose solution and saline flush, as ethanol induced hypoglycaemia is unresponsive to glucagon; 2) Administration of the vitamin thiamine to prevent Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which can cause a seizure; 3) application of haemodialysis if the blood concentration is dangerously high (>400 mg%), and especially if there is metabolic acidosis and 4) Providing oxygen therapy as needed via nasal cannula or non-rebreather mask.",2009-05-06 21:37:51+00:00,2014-12-24 20:22:48+00:00,Ethanol,,C00469,,16236.0,ETOH,D000431,Ethanol,DB00898,EOH,594.0,True,CCO,C2H6O,"InChI=1S/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3",InChIKey=LFQSCWFLJHTTHZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,46.0684,46.041864814,Endogenous,1,-0.31,HMDB00108,CHEMBL545,682.0,,"<p>William S.

663.0,773.0,T3D0772,Ethylene glycol ,"Ethylene glycol (monoethylene glycol (MEG), IUPAC name: ethane-1,2-diol) is an alcohol with two -OH groups (a diol), a chemical compound widely used as an automotive antifreeze. Ethylene glycol is toxic, and its accidental ingestion should be considered a medical emergency. (L1023)",107-21-1,174.0,C2H6O2,62.03678,"Odorless, colorless, syrupy liquid (L1023).",-13°C,,"1000 mg/mL [RIDDICK,JA et al. (1986)]",Oral (T29) ; dermal (T29),"Ethylene glycol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to glycoaldehyde, which is then metabolized to glycolic, glyoxylic, and oxalic acids. These acids, along with excess lactic acid are responsible for the anion gap metabolic acidosis. Oxalic acid readily precipitates with calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. Tissue injury is caused by widespread deposition of oxalate crystals and the toxic effects of glycolic and glyoxylic acids. Ethylene glycol produces central nervous system depression. The glycol probably causes the initial CNS depression; oxalate and the other intermediates seem to be responsible for nephrotoxicity. Glycoaldehyde and glyoxylate may be the principal metabolites responsible for EG nephrotoxicity and do so by causing ATP depletion and phospholipid and enzyme destruction. Glycine and acidosis, by-products of EG metabolism, can attenuate glyoxylate-mediated injury. This suggests that naturally occurring but incomplete protective pathways may be operative during the evolution of EG cytotoxicity. (A612, A613, A310)","The main steps in degradation of ethylene glycol are as follows: ethylene glycol--> glycoaldehyde--> glycolic and glyoxylic acid. Glyoxylic acid is then metabolized into a number of chemicals that have been identified in expired air, urine, or blood. The metabolism of ethylene glycol to glycoaldehyde is mediated by alcohol dehydrogenase. Glycoaldehyde is metabolized to glycolic acid by aldehyde oxidase or to a lesser extent to glyoxal. Glyoxal is changed both to glycolic acid in the presence of lactic dehydrogenase, aldehyde oxidase, or possibly both enzymes, and to glyoxylic acid via some oxidative mechanism. The main path of the degradation of glycolic acid is to glyoxylic acid. This reaction is mediated by lactic dehydrogenase or glycolic acid oxidase. Once glyoxylic acid is formed, it is apparently degraded very rapidly to a variety of products, a few of which have been observed. Its breakdown to 2-hydroxy-3-oxoadipate it is thought, is mediated by thiamine pyrophosphate in the presence of magnesium ions. The formation of glycine involves pyridoxal phosphate and glyoxylate transaminase, whereas the formation of carbon dioxide and water via formic acid apparently involves coenzyme A (CoA) and flavin mononucleotides. Oxalic acid formation from glyoxylic acid, has been considered to be the results from the action of lactic dehydrogenase or glycolic acid oxidase. (T29)","LD50: 4700 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L1025)

Stage 3 of ethylene glycol poisoning is the result of kidney injury, leading to acute kidney failure. Oxalic acid reacts with calcium and forms calcium oxalate crystals in the kidney (L1023). ","Symptoms of ethylene glycol poisoning usually follow a three-step progression. Stage 1 consists of neurological symptoms including victims appearing to be intoxicated, exhibiting symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, slurred speech, and confusion. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins, it is first metabolized to glycolaldehyde, which is then oxidized to glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid, and finally oxalic acid. Stage 2 is a result of accumulation of these metabolites and consists of tachycardia, hypertension, hyperventilation, and metabolic acidosis. Stage 3 of ethylene glycol poisoning is the result of kidney injury, leading to acute kidney failure. Oxalic acid reacts with calcium and forms calcium oxalate crystals in the kidney. (L1023, A2703)","Initial treatment consists of stabilizing the patient and gastric decontamination. Gastric lavage or nasogastric aspiration of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning. Ipecac-induced vomiting or activated charcoal. The antidotes for ethylene glycol poisoning are ethanol or fomepizole; antidotal treatment forms the mainstay of management following ingestion. Ethanol (usually given IV as a 5 or 10% solution in 5% dextrose and water, but also sometimes given in the form of a strong spirit such as whisky, vodka or gin) acts by competing with ethylene glycol for the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase thus limiting the formation of toxic metabolites. Fomepizole acts by inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase, thus blocking the formation of the toxic metabolites.

(1968)]",Inhalation  (L96) ; oral (L96) ; dermal (L96),"Organic nitriles decompose into cyanide ions both in vivo and in vitro. Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",Organic nitriles are converted into cyanide ions through the action of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. Cyanide is rapidly absorbed and distributed throughout the body. Cyanide is mainly metabolized into thiocyanate by either rhodanese or 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase. Cyanide metabolites are excreted in the urine.

Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) is a constituent of mustard, horseradish and wasabi and certain vegetables found in the human diet, mostly in cruciferous vegetables. AITC is a colorless to pale yellow liquid that is slightly soluble in water, but well soluble in most organic solvents. AITC possesses numerous biochemical and physiological activities. It is cytotoxic and tumorigenic at high doses and also is a modulator of enzymes involved in metabolism of xenobiotics, including carcinogens. It is plausible that the wide consumption of dietary AITC may have profound effects on human health. oxidative DNA damage may play important roles in carcinogenic processes induced by AITC. Allergic contact dermatitis from AICT is well known but infrequently reported. AITC is occasionally found as a volatile component of normal human biofluids.

The affinity for the Ah receptor depends on the structure of the specific CDD. The change in gene expression may result from the direct interaction of the Ah receptor and its heterodimer-forming partner, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, with gene regulatory elements or the initiation of a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade that subsequently activates other transcription factors. The affected genes include several oncogenes, growth factors, receptors, hormones, and drug-metabolizing enzymes. The change in transcription/translation of these genes is believed to be the cause of most of the toxic effects of CDDs.

Prolonged dermal exposure may include skin irritation, whereas prolonged inhalation exposure may lead to coughing and burning sensations in the upper respiratory tract and chest. (L177)","The general treatment of acute chlorophenoxy herbicide poisoning consists of decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract, resuscitation and supportive care. For severe, acute oral poisoning by 2,4-DB or 2,4-D, forced alkaline diuresis appears to be most effective (A7734). Forced alkaline diuresis is often used to increase the excretion of acidic drugs like salicylates and phenobarbitone. For forced alkaline diuresis, a diuretic like furosemide is given intravenously and sodium bicarbonate is added to the infusion fluid to make blood and, in turn, urine alkaline. Potassium replacement becomes of utmost importance during the process because potassium is usually lost in urine. If blood levels of potassium are depleted below normal levels, then hypokalemia occurs, which promotes bicarbonate ion retention and prevents bicarbonate excretion, thus interfering with the alkalinization of the urine.",2009-06-02 22:18:41+00:00,2014-12-24 20:22:50+00:00,,,C14404,,73173.0,CPD-335,C004764,"2,4-Dichlorophenoxybutyric acid",,,6426.0,True,OC(=O)CCCOC1=CC=C(Cl)C=C1Cl,C10H10Cl2O3,"InChI=1S/C10H10Cl2O3/c11-7-3-4-9(8(12)6-7)15-5-1-2-10(13)14/h3-4,6H,1-2,5H2,(H,13,14)",InChIKey=YIVXMZJTEQBPQO-UHFFFAOYSA-N,249.091,248.0006996,Exogenous,0,,,CHEMBL1892377,1444.0,,,,"(2,4-Dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid

689.0,809.0,T3D0808,Paraquat dichloride,"Paraquat dichloride is a constituent of numerous proprietary herbicides. A large majority (93%) of fatalities from paraquat poisoning are cases of intentional self-administration, ie, suicides. In third world countries, paraquat is a major suicide agent. For instance, in Samoa from 1979-2001, 70% of suicides were by Paraquat poisoning. In Southern Trinidad from 1996-1997, 76% of suicides were by paraquat. However, independent bodies have studied paraquat in this use. Jenny Pronczuk de Garbino, stated: no lung or other injury in marijuana users has ever been attributed to paraquat contamination. Also a United States Environmental Protection Agency manual states: &hellip; toxic effects caused by this mechanism have been either very rare or nonexistent. Most paraquat that contaminates marijuana is pyrolyzed during smoking to dipyridyl, which is a product of combustion of the leaf material itself (including marijuana) and presents little toxic hazard. Paraquat is the trade name for N,N -dimethyl-4,4 -bipyridinium dichloride, one of the most widely used herbicides in the world. Paraquat, a viologen, is quick-acting and non-selective, killing green plant tissue on contact. It is also toxic to human beings when swallowed. Paraquat is used as a quaternary ammonium herbicide; one of the most widely used herbicides in the world. It is quick-acting, non-selective, and kills green plant tissue on contact. It is redistributed within the plant but does not harm mature bark. Being a herbicide, paraquat protects crops by controlling a wide range of annual and certain perennial weeds that reduce crop yield and quality by competing with the crop for water, nutrients, and light. Pure paraquat ingested is highly toxic to mammals and humans potentially leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and there are no specific antidotes. However, fuller's earth or activated charcoal is an effective treatment, if taken in time. Death may occur up to 30 days after ingestion. Diluted paraquat used for spraying is less so, thus the greatest risk of accidental poisoning is during mixing and loading Paraquat for use.",1910-42-5,15938.0,C12H14Cl2N2,256.0534,Off-white powder (L421).,>400°C,,700 mg/mL at 20°C,Inhalation (T44) ; oral (T44) ; eye contat (T44) ; dermal (T44),"The mechanisms of the toxic effects of paraquat are largely the result of a metabolically catalyzed single electron oxidation reduction reaction, resulting in depletion of cellular NADPH and the generation of potentially toxic forms of oxygen such as the superoxide radical (A607). Recent studies have demonstrated paraquat cytotoxicity occurs in the mitochondria and particularly in mitochondrial-rich tissues. The mitochondrial NADH-dependent PQ reductase containing a voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1)  appears to be largely responsible for paraquat cytotoxicity. When mitochondria are incubated with NADH and paraquat, the superoxide anion is produced, and the mitochondria rupture.  Ruptured mitochondria lead to rapid cell death (A3102).","Paraquat is poorly absorbed after oral exposure. It is not metabolized but is reduced to an unstable free radical which is then re-oxidized to reform the cation and produce a superoxide anion. It is excreted moslty in the urine,and in small fraction also in the feces (A606, L1008). ","LD50: 150 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L1008)

It is also often used in science to catalyze the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  (L421).,,"It can cause temporary damage to nails and if swalloed, may cause nose bleeding. Long term exposures to paraquat would most likely cause lung and eye damage. Some suspect a possible link to a greater incidence of Parkinson's disease. Pancreatitis may develop in some cases of acute. Paraquat is caustic to the oral, esophageal, and gastric mucosa (T36, A545, L421).","Eye or skin irritation; hypotension may develop after large ingestion;  epistaxis and sore throat may develop after inhalation. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common (T36).","In case of  oral exposure, administer charcoal as a slurry. Consider after ingestion of a potentially life-threatening amount of poison if it can be performed soon after ingestion. The treatment is symptomatic and supportive. In case of eye exposure, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. In case of dermal exposure, remove contaminated clothing and jewellery. Wash the skin, including hair and nails, vigorously; do repeated soap washings. Discard contaminated clothing.

713.0,870.0,T3D0868,4-Chlorophenol,4-Chlorophenol or para-chlorophenol is a monochlorophenol isomer that has a chlorine atom in the para position. It is used as a disinfectant agent (L159).,106-48-9,,C6H5ClO,,White powder.,42.8°C,,"24 mg/mL at 25°C [ROBERTS,MS et al. (1977)]",Inhalation (L159) ; oral (L159) ; dermal (L159),"4-chlorophenol works as a weak uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation and inhibitors of cellular respiration. The ability of chlorophenols to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation increases with increasing chlorination. In fact, studies indicate a concentration-dependent triphasic effect of chlorophenols on phosphorylation and cellular respiration. At low concentrations, uncoupling produces stimulation of the resting state respiration as a result of increased adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity in the absence of a phosphate acceptor.Inhibition of active respiration is also observed. At moderate concentrations, resting respiration is neither stimulated nor inhibited. Significant inhibition of respiration, associated with a breakdown of the electron transport process and decreased ATPase activity, occurs at very high concentrations. Uncoupling activity has been attributed to a protonophoric effect (a disruption of the energy gradient across the mitochondrial membrane resulting from distribution of chlorophenols in the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane), whereas inhibition of cellular respiration has been attributed to a direct action on intracellular proteins (L159).",Absorption of 4-chlorophenol is favored in the stomach and the intestine. Absorption through the gastrointestinal tract is by simple diffusion and is expected to be both rapid and virtually complete. It is proposed that 4-CP is metabolized by P-450 enzymes to intermediates that react with glutathione to form glutathionyl adducts.The metabolism of the 4-chlorophenol is principally via conjugation. The principal metabolite ecreted is the glucuronide. Other metabolites are sulfate conjugates such as the ethereal sulfate. The metabobites are excreted in urine (L159). ,"LD50: 670 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L724)

(L135),Breathing in contaminated air; drinking contaminated water; dermal and eye exposure (L159).,Acute Oral: 0.01 mg/kg/day (Rat) (L159),"4-chlorophenol is corrosive to epithelial tissue. It produce effects ranging from slight hyperemia to severe corrosion when applied to the corneas. Acute inhalation exposure may lead to hemorrhage in the lungs and tachypnea. Oral exposure to 2-chlorophenol can produce a variety of neurological effects, including tremors, myoclonic convulsions, a hunched posture, dyspnea, collapse, and coma (L159). ","Cough, shortness of breath and sore throat can result from inhalation of 2-chlorophenol. These symptoms may be delayed. Abdominal pain, drowsiness, weakness, and convulsions can result from ingestion as well as inhalation. moreover, ingestion of 2-chlorophenol can cause restlessness, tremors, or central nervous system depression to occur. Eye exposure to 2-chlorophenol can lead to redness, pain, and blurred vision, while dermal contact can lead to redness and pain of the skin. Moreover, the substance can be rapidily absorbed after derma exposure (L159).","Avoid dilution following oral exposure; instead, administer charcoal as a slurry. Following inhalation, move patient to fresh air. Monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids. If the exposure occurs through eye contact, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes.

Thus the poison uncouples phosphorylation from oxidation. Free energy from the electron transport chain then converts to more body heat. As body temp rises, heat-dissipating mechanisms are overcome and metabolism is speeded. More adenosine diphosphate and other substrates accumulate, and these substrates stimulate the electron transport chain further. The electron transport chain responds by using up more and more available oxygen (increasing oxygen demand) in an effort to produce adenosine triphosphate, but much of the free energy generated is liberated as still more body heat. Oxygen demand quickly overcomes oxygen supply, and energy reserves become depleted (A541).","2,3,5,6-Tetrachlorophenol is rapidly absorbed and excreted following occupational exposure, which involves both the inhalation and dermal routes.

Aldicarb is effective against thrips, aphids, spider mites, lygus, fleahoppers, and leafminers, but is primarily used as a nematicide. Aldicarb is effective where resistance to organophosphate insecticides has developed, and is extremely important in potato production, where it is used for the control of soil-borne nematodes and some foliar pests. Its weakness is its high level of solubility, which restricts its use in certain areas where the water table is close to the surface. Most of the carbamates are extremely toxic to Hymenoptera, and precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to foraging bees or parasitic wasps. Aldicarb was one of the 'dirty dozen' pesticides that the environmental group Pesticide Action Network North America targeted in 1985.

Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax.

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Chronically high (>10 years) exposure leads to neuropsychological consequences including disturbances in perception and visuo-motor processing (A15321).","As with organophosphates, the signs and symptoms are based on excessive cholinergic stimulation. Unlike organophosphate poisoning, carbamate poisonings tend to be of shorter duration because the inhibition of nervous tissue acetylcholinesterase is reversible, and carbamates are more rapidly metabolized. Muscle weakness, dizziness, sweating and slight body discomfort are commonly reported early symptoms. Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are often prominent at higher levels of exposure.

If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

They are widely used in homes, gardens and agriculture. The first carbamate, carbaryl, was introduced in 1956 and more of it has been used throughout the world than all other carbamates combined. Because of carbaryl's relatively low mammalian oral and dermal toxicity and broad control spectrum, it has had wide use in lawn and garden settings. Most of the carbamates are extremely toxic to Hymenoptera, and precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to foraging bees or parasitic wasps. Some of the carbamates are translocated within plants, making them an effective systemic treatment.

794.0,973.0,T3D0969,Fenoxycarb,"Fenoxycarb is a carbamate pesticide. Carbamate pesticides are derived from carbamic acid and kill insects in a similar fashion as organophosphate insecticides. They are widely used in homes, gardens and agriculture. The first carbamate, carbaryl, was introduced in 1956 and more of it has been used throughout the world than all other carbamates combined. Because of carbaryl's relatively low mammalian oral and dermal toxicity and broad control spectrum, it has had wide use in lawn and garden settings. Most of the carbamates are extremely toxic to Hymenoptera, and precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to foraging bees or parasitic wasps. Some of the carbamates are translocated within plants, making them an effective systemic treatment. (L795)",72490-01-8,51605.0,C17H19NO4,301.13141,White powder.,53.5°C,,"0.006 mg/mL at 20°C [SHIU,WY et al. (1990)]",Inhalation  (L793) ; oral (L793); dermal (L793),"Fenoxycarb is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. Carbamates form unstable complexes with chlolinesterases by carbamoylation of the active sites of the enzymes.  This inhibition is reversible. A cholinesterase inhibitor suppresses the action of acetylcholine esterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholine esterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses.  Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are often prominent at higher levels of exposure. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop.",The carbamates are hydrolyzed enzymatically by the liver; degradation products are excreted by the kidneys and the liver. (L793),"LD50: >10 000 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T71)",,Spraying and application of nonarsenical insecticides entail exposures that are probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A). (L135),"Fenoxycarb is widely used as an insecticide or pesticide in homes, gardens and agricultural applications. It is a synthetic compound.",,"Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Chronically high (>10 years) exposure leads to neuropsychological consequences including disturbances in perception and visuo-motor processing (A15321).","As with organophosphates, the signs and symptoms are based on excessive cholinergic stimulation. Unlike organophosphate poisoning, carbamate poisonings tend to be of shorter duration because the inhibition of nervous tissue acetylcholinesterase is reversible, and carbamates are more rapidly metabolized. Muscle weakness, dizziness, sweating and slight body discomfort are commonly reported early symptoms. Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are often prominent at higher levels of exposure. Contraction of the pupils with blurred vision, incoordination, muscle twitching and slurred speech have been reported. (L795)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

817.0,996.0,T3D0992,Oxamyl,"Oxamyl is a carbamate pesticide. Carbamate pesticides are derived from carbamic acid and kill insects in a similar fashion as organophosphate insecticides. They are widely used in homes, gardens and agriculture. The first carbamate, carbaryl, was introduced in 1956 and more of it has been used throughout the world than all other carbamates combined. Because of carbaryl's relatively low mammalian oral and dermal toxicity and broad control spectrum, it has had wide use in lawn and garden settings. Most of the carbamates are extremely toxic to Hymenoptera, and precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to foraging bees or parasitic wasps. Some of the carbamates are translocated within plants, making them an effective systemic treatment.

Carbamates form unstable complexes with chlolinesterases by carbamoylation of the active sites of the enzymes.  This inhibition is reversible. A cholinesterase inhibitor suppresses the action of acetylcholine esterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholine esterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses.  Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are often prominent at higher levels of exposure. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop.",The carbamates are hydrolyzed enzymatically by the liver; degradation products are excreted by the kidneys and the liver.

It is a synthetic compound.",,"Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Chronically high (>10 years) exposure leads to neuropsychological consequences including disturbances in perception and visuo-motor processing (A15321).","As with organophosphates, the signs and symptoms are based on excessive cholinergic stimulation. Unlike organophosphate poisoning, carbamate poisonings tend to be of shorter duration because the inhibition of nervous tissue acetylcholinesterase is reversible, and carbamates are more rapidly metabolized. Muscle weakness, dizziness, sweating and slight body discomfort are commonly reported early symptoms. Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are often prominent at higher levels of exposure. Contraction of the pupils with blurred vision, incoordination, muscle twitching and slurred speech have been reported. (L795)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-06-17 23:53:05+00:00,2014-12-24 20:23:01+00:00,,,,,38539.0,,C011960,Oxamyl,,,1111.0,True,CNC(=O)O\N=C(/SC)C(=O)N(C)C,C7H13N3O3S,"InChI=1S/C7H13N3O3S/c1-8-7(12)13-9-5(14-4)6(11)10(2)3/h1-4H3,(H,8,12)/b9-5-",InChIKey=KZAUOCCYDRDERY-UITAMQMPSA-N,219.261,219.067761987,Exogenous,0,,,,,,,,"Blade

849.0,1030.0,T3D1026,Phenothrin,"Phenothrin, also called sumithrin, is a synthetic pyrethroid  (type 1) that kills adult fleas and ticks. It has also been used to kill head lice in humans. d-phenothrin is used as a component of aerosol insecticides for domestic use. Phenothrin is often used with methoprene, an insect growth regulator that interrupts the insect's biological life cycle by killing the eggs. In 2005, the EPA required Hartz Mountain Industries to cancel uses of several flea and tick products containing phenothrin that were linked to a range of adverse reactions, including hair loss, salivation, tremors, and numerous deaths in cats and kittens. In the short term, the agreement called for new warning labels on the products. A pyrethroid is a synthetic chemical compound similar to the natural chemical pyrethrins produced by the flowers of pyrethrums (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and C. coccineum). Pyrethroids are common in commercial products such as household insecticides and insect repellents. In the concentrations used in such products, they are generally harmless to human beings but can harm sensitive individuals. They are usually broken apart by sunlight and the atmosphere in one or two days, and do not significantly affect groundwater quality except for being toxic to fish.

They appear to bind to the membrane lipid phase in the immediate vicinity of the sodium channel, thus modifying the channel kinetics. This blocks the closing of the sodium gates in the nerves, and thus prolongs the return of the membrane potential to its resting state. The repetitive (sensory, motor) neuronal discharge and a prolonged negative afterpotential produces effects quite similar to those produced by DDT, leading to hyperactivity of the nervous system which can result in paralysis and/or death. Other mechanisms of action of pyrethroids include antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, modulation of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, enhancement of noradrenaline release, and actions on calcium ions. They also inhibit calium channels and Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase. (T10, T18, L857)","d-Phenothrin is a fast acting  insecticide, effective by contact and stomach action. It is rapidly metabolized and excreted by humans and has low human toxicity.  For both cis- and trans- isomers, the product was metabolized by hydrolysis, oxidation and conjugation and a large part of d-Phenothrin is excreted unchanged in the urine and the faeces.   Following oral administration of the (1R)- trans - isomer, the urine is the major excretory route.  The isomer is extensively metabolized to oxidative and conjugated derivatives of the hydrolysed ester.  Oxidative and conjugated derivatives of the
(1R)- cis -isomer are also observed but hydrolysis of the ester linkage is a minor metabolic pathway.  With this isomer the faeces is the major excretory route. The metabolic profiles aree similar following dermal application, although the rates of excretion for each isomer showed some differences between the two routes of administration.  The major metabolite is 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol (PBalc). Smaller amounts of PBacid and trace amounts of 4'-OH-PBacid are also found.  It is stable to storage in the dark; d-Phenothrin is relatively unstable to sunlight or ultra violet irradiation, or in alkaline media. (L866, A561)","LD50: > 5000 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (A561)

850.0,1031.0,T3D1027,Resmethrin,"Resmethrin is a pyrethroid insecticide with many uses, including control of the adult mosquito population. It is also used for fabric protection, pet sprays and shampoos, and it is applied to horses or in horse stables. Technical resmethrin is a mixture of its two main isomers (molecules with the same chemical formula but slightly different configurations); a typical blend is 20 to 30% of the (1RS)-cis-isomer and 70 to 80% of the (1RS)-trans-isomer. A commercial trade names for products that contain resmethrin are Chrysron, Crossfire, Pynosect, Raid Flying Insect Killer, Scourge, Sun-Bugger #4, SPB-1382, Synthrin, Syntox, Vectrin and Whitmire PT-110.  A pyrethroid is a synthetic chemical compound similar to the natural chemical pyrethrins produced by the flowers of pyrethrums (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and C. coccineum). Pyrethroids are common in commercial products such as household insecticides and insect repellents. In the concentrations used in such products, they are generally harmless to human beings but can harm sensitive individuals. They are usually broken apart by sunlight and the atmosphere in one or two days, and do not significantly affect groundwater quality except for being toxic to fish. (L811, L879, L880)",10453-86-8,5053.0,C22H26O3,338.1882,"Waxy, off-white to tan solid with an odor characteristic of chrysanthemums (L880).",56.5°C,,"3.79e-05 mg/mL at 25°C [TOMLIN,C (1997)]",Inhalation (L857) ; oral (L857) ; dermal (L857) ; eye contact (L857).,"Both type I and type II pyrethroids exert their effect by prolonging the open phase of the sodium channel gates when a nerve cell is excited. They appear to bind to the membrane lipid phase in the immediate vicinity of the sodium channel, thus modifying the channel kinetics. This blocks the closing of the sodium gates in the nerves, and thus prolongs the return of the membrane potential to its resting state. The repetitive (sensory, motor) neuronal discharge and a prolonged negative afterpotential produces effects quite similar to those produced by DDT, leading to hyperactivity of the nervous system which can result in paralysis and/or death. Other mechanisms of action of pyrethroids include antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, modulation of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, enhancement of noradrenaline release, and actions on calcium ions. They also inhibit calium channels and Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase. (T10, T18, L857)","Following ingestion, pyrethriods are hydrolysed by various digestive enzymes in the gastro-intestinal tract. However, a small portion of the insecticidally active compounds or its derivatives are absorbed, as shown by their toxicity and their effect on the liver. Pyrethriods may also be absorbed following inhalation or dermal contact. They are rapidly distributed to most tissues, particularly to those with a high lipid content, and are concentrated in central and peripheral nervous tissues. Pyrethriods or their metabolites are not known to be stored in the body or to be excreted in the milk, but no study of the matter has employed modern methods. The major metabolic pathways for pyrethriods are hydrolysis of the central ester bond, oxidative attacks at several sites, and conjugation reactions, to produce a complex array of primary and secondary water-soluble metabolites that undergo urinary excretion. Metabolism is believed to involve nonspecific microsomal carboxyesterases and microsomal mixed function oxidases, which are located in nearly all tissue types, with particularly high activities in the liver. Metabolites are excreted in the urine and faeces. (L857, L889)","LD50: > 5000 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (A561)

Paresthesia, severe corneal damage, hypotension and tachycardia, associated with anaphylaxis, can also occur following pyrethriod poisoning. (L857)","Following oral exposure, severe fine tremor, marked reflex hyperexcitability, sympathetic activation can occur. Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain commonly occur and develop following ingestion. Sudden bronchospasm, swelling of oral and laryngeal mucous membranes, and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported after inhalation. Hypersensitivity reactions characterized by pneumonitis, cough, dyspnea, wheezing, chest pain, irritability to sound and touch, and bronchospasm may occur too. Dermatitis is the main effect of a dermal exposure resmethrin. (T36)","Following oral exposure, the treatment is symptomatic and supportive and includes monitoring for the development of hypersensitivity reactions with respiratory distress.

If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids. In case of eye exposure, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. If irritation, pain, swelling, lacrimation, or photophobia persist, the patient should be seen in a health care facility.

It is easily degraded on soil and plants but can be effective for weeks when applied to indoor inert surfaces. Exposure to sunlight, water and oxygen will accelerate its decomposition. It is a synthetic pyrethroid. Cypermethrin is highly toxic to fish, bees and aquatic insects, according to the National Pesticides Telecommunications Network (NPTN). Cypermethrin is found in many household ant and cockroach killers, including Raid and ant chalk.

859.0,1040.0,T3D1036,Esfenvalerate,"Esfenvalerate is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide which is used on a wide range of pests such as moths, flies, beetles, and other insects. It is used on vegetable crops, tree fruit, and nut crops. It may be mixed with a wide variety of other types of pesticides such as carbamate compounds or organophosphates. Esfenvalerate has replaced the naturally occurring compound fenvalerate (to which it is almost identical) for use in the U.S. Much of the data for fenvalerate is applicable to the pesticide esfenvalerate because the two compounds contain the same components. The only differences in the two products are the relative proportions of the four separate constituents (isomers). Esfenvalerate has become the preferred compound because it requires lower applications rates than fenvalerate, is less chronically toxic, and is a more powerful insecticide. The compound contains a much higher percentage of the one insecticidally active isomer (84% for esfenvalerate and 22% for fenvalerate). A pyrethroid is a synthetic chemical compound similar to the natural chemical pyrethrins produced by the flowers of pyrethrums (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and C. coccineum). Pyrethroids are common in commercial products such as household insecticides and insect repellents. In the concentrations used in such products, they are generally harmless to human beings but can harm sensitive individuals. They are usually broken apart by sunlight and the atmosphere in one or two days, and do not significantly affect groundwater quality except for being toxic to fish.

They appear to bind to the membrane lipid phase in the immediate vicinity of the sodium channel, thus modifying the channel kinetics. This blocks the closing of the sodium gates in the nerves, and thus prolongs the return of the membrane potential to its resting state. The repetitive (sensory, motor) neuronal discharge and a prolonged negative afterpotential produces effects quite similar to those produced by DDT, leading to hyperactivity of the nervous system which can result in paralysis and/or death. Other mechanisms of action of pyrethroids include antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, modulation of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, enhancement of noradrenaline release, and actions on calcium ions. They also inhibit calium channels and Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase.

However, a small portion of the insecticidally active compounds or its derivatives are absorbed, as shown by their toxicity and their effect on the liver. Pyrethriods may also be absorbed following inhalation or dermal contact. They are rapidly distributed to most tissues, particularly to those with a high lipid content, and are concentrated in central and peripheral nervous tissues. Pyrethriods or their metabolites are not known to be stored in the body or to be excreted in the milk, but no study of the matter has employed modern methods. The major metabolic pathways for pyrethriods are hydrolysis of the central ester bond, oxidative attacks at several sites, and conjugation reactions, to produce a complex array of primary and secondary water-soluble metabolites that undergo urinary excretion. Metabolism is believed to involve nonspecific microsomal carboxyesterases and microsomal mixed function oxidases, which are located in nearly all tissue types, with particularly high activities in the liver.

On the other hand, the major fecal metabolites are anilino acid, its amide derivative, and several conjugates of anilino acid with several endogenous components. An unexpected difference between fluvalinate and other pyrethroids is the minimal amt of hydroxylation at the 4'-position of the alcohol moiety.

Decreased levels of T4 would result in increased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Increased levels of TSH would result in the hyperplastic and eventually tumorigenic response of the thyroid. Propachlor metabolites also bind to nAChRs in the nervous system and cause endocrine disruption in humans by binding to and inhibiting the estrogen receptor. (T10, A570, T152)","Propachlor can be absorbed in mammals through the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts as well as through the skin.  It does not accumulate in the body, since it is rapidly metabolized through the mercapturic acid pathway (MAP). Cysteine conjugates are formed by glutathione conjugation and this conjugate has been proposed as an intermediate in the metabolic formation of mercapturic acid conjugation.  It has been shown that a cysteine conjugate of propachlor is the source of sulfur in methylsulfonyl- containing metabolites, but that the carbon in the methylsulfonyl group does not come from the cysteine moiety. Propachlor is conjugated firstly with glutathione and the reaction is mediated by glutathione transferases. The glutathione conjugation provides a means for inactivation of reactive electrophiles. Glutathione conjugates have the required physico-chemical properties for biliary excretion and will generally be present, together with their catabolites cysteinyl-glycine, cysteine and N-acetylcysteine-mercapturic acid, in relatively high concentrations in the bile. After excretion with the bile, they are metabolized in the intestine where the C-S lyase present cleaves the cysteine conjugate, allowing further metabolism of sulfur to a methylsulfonyl-containing moiety. Eleven urinary metabolites, six of which are 2-methylsulfonylacetanalides have been isolated. The major fecal metabolite is identified as the cysteine conjugate.

Copper hepatotoxicity is believed to occur when the lysosomes become saturated and copper accumulates in the nucleus, causing nuclear damage. This damage is possibly a result of oxidative damage, including lipid peroxidation. Copper inhibits the sulfhydryl group enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and paraoxonases, which protect the cell from free oxygen radicals. It also influences gene expression and is a co-factor for oxidative enzymes such as cytochrome C oxidase and lysyl oxidase. In addition, the oxidative stress induced by copper is thought to activate acid sphingomyelinase, which lead to the production of ceramide, an apoptotic signal, as well as cause hemolytic anemia. Copper-induced emesis results from stimulation of the vagus nerve.

It passes through the basolateral membrane, possibly via regulatory copper transporters, and is transported to the liver and kidney bound to serum albumin. The liver is the critical organ for copper homoeostasis. In the liver and other tissues, copper is stored bound to metallothionein, amino acids, and in association with copper-dependent enzymes, then partitioned for excretion through the bile or incorporation into intra- and extracellular proteins. The transport of copper to the peripheral tissues is accomplished through the plasma attached to serum albumin, ceruloplasmin or low-molecular-weight complexes. Copper may induce the production of metallothionein and ceruloplasmin. The membrane-bound copper transporting adenosine triphosphatase (Cu-ATPase) transports copper ions into and out of cells.

Copper hepatotoxicity is believed to occur when the lysosomes become saturated and copper accumulates in the nucleus, causing nuclear damage. This damage is possibly a result of oxidative damage, including lipid peroxidation. Copper inhibits the sulfhydryl group enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and paraoxonases, which protect the cell from free oxygen radicals. It also influences gene expression and is a co-factor for oxidative enzymes such as cytochrome C oxidase and lysyl oxidase. In addition, the oxidative stress induced by copper is thought to activate acid sphingomyelinase, which lead to the production of ceramide, an apoptotic signal, as well as cause hemolytic anemia.

Organotin compounds stimulate the neuronal release of and/or decrease of neuronal cell uptake of neurotransmitters in brain tissue, including aspartate, GABA, glutamate, norepinephrine, and serotonin. This may be either a contributing factor to or result of the neuronal cell loss. The immunotoxic effects of organotins are characterized by thymic atrophy caused by the suppression of proliferation of immature thymocytes and apoptosis of mature thymocytes. Organotin compounds are believed to exert these effects by suppressing DNA and protein synthesis, inducing the expression of genes involved in apoptosis (such as nur77), and disrupting the regulation of intracellular calcium levels, giving rise to the uncontrolled production of reactive oxygen species, release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and the proteolytic and nucleolytic cascade of apoptosis. The suppression of proliferation of immature thymocytes further results in the suppression of T-cell-mediated immune responses.

Mercury is known to bind to microsomal and mitochondrial enzymes, resulting in cell injury and death. For example, mercury is known to inhibit aquaporins, halting water flow across the cell membrane. It also inhibits the protein LCK, which causes decreased T-cell signalling and immune system depression. Mercury is also believed to inhibit neuronal excitability by acting on the postsynaptic neuronal membrane. It also affects the nervous system by inhibiting protein kinase C and alkaline phosphatase, which impairs brain microvascular formation and function, as well as alters the blood-brain barrier.

It is genotoxic, and some nickel compounds have been shown to promote cell proliferation. Nickel has a high affinity for chromatin proteins, particularly histones and protamines. The complexing of nickel ions with heterochromatin results in a number of alterations including condensation, DNA hypermethylation, gene silencing, and inhibition of histone acetylation, which have been shown to disturb gene expression. Nickel has also been shown to alter several transcription factors, including hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, activating transcription factor, and NF-KB transcription factor. There is also evidence that nickel ions inhibit DNA repair, either by directly inhibiting DNA repair enzymes or competing with zinc ions for binding to zinc-finger DNA binding proteins, resulting in structural changes in DNA that prevent repair enzymes from binding. Nickel ions can also complex with a number of cellular ligands including amino acids, peptides, and proteins resulting in the generation of oxygen radicals, which induce base damage, DNA strand breaks, and DNA protein crosslinks. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L41, A40, L97)","Nickel is absorbed mainly through the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Once in the body it enters the bloodstream, where it binds to albumin, L-histidine, and _2-macroglobulin. Nickel tends to accumulate in the lungs, thyroid, kidney, heart, and liver.

(L980, L739, L740, L770)",20859-73-8,30332.0,AlP,57.9553,Yellow or gray crystals.,,,,Oral (L739) ; Inhalation (L739),"The main target organs of aluminum are the central nervous system and bone. Aluminum binds with dietary phosphorus and impairs gastrointestinal absorption of phosphorus. The decreased phosphate body burden results in osteomalacia (softening of the bones due to defective bone mineralization) and rickets. Aluminum's neurotoxicity is believed to involve several mechanisms. Changes in cytoskeletal protein functions as a results of altered phosphorylation, proteolysis, transport, and synthesis are believed to be one cause. Aluminum may induce neurobehavioral effects by affecting permeability of the blood-brain barrier, cholinergic activity, signal transduction pathways, lipid peroxidation, and impair neuronal glutamate nitric oxide-cyclic GMP pathway, as well as interfere with metabolism of essential trace elements because of similar coordination chemistries and consequent competitive interactions. It has been suggested that aluminum's interaction with estrogen receptors increases the expression of estrogen-related genes and thereby contributes to the progression of breast cancer (A235), but studies have not been able to establish a clear link between aluminum and increased risk of breast cancer (A15468). Certain aluminum salts induce immune responses by activating inflammasomes.   Phosphine inhibits cytochrome c oxidase, preventing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This non-competitive inhibition prevents cellular respiration and leads to multi-organ dysfunction. Phosphine can also react with hydrogen peroxide to form the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, which can cause lipid peroxidation. (A291, A292, L739, A235, A236)","Aluminum is poorly absorbed following either oral or inhalation exposure and is essentially not absorbed dermally. The bioavailability of aluminum is strongly influenced by the aluminum compound and the presence of dietary constituents which can complex with aluminum and enhance or inhibit its absorption. Aluminum binds to various ligands in the blood and distributes to every organ, with highest concentrations found in bone and lung tissues. In living organisms, aluminum is believed to exist in four different forms: as free ions, as low-molecular-weight complexes, as physically bound macromolecular complexes, and as covalently bound macromolecular complexes. Absorbed aluminum is excreted principally in the urine and, to a lesser extent, in the bile, while unabsorbed aluminum is excreted in the faeces.   Phosphine and metal phosphides may be absorbed following ingestion or inhalation, then distribute to the nervous system, liver, and kidney. In the body, metal phosphides are hydrolysed to phosphine, and phosphine is oxidized to hypophosphite and phosphite. Metabolites are excreted in the urine, while unchanged phosphine is exhaled.

Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase.

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Cyanide is rapidly alsorbed through oral, inhalation, and dermal routes and distributed throughout the body.

(L135)",,,"Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Cyanide poisoning is identified by rapid, deep breathing and shortness of breath, general weakness, giddiness, headaches, vertigo, confusion, convulsions/seizures and eventually loss of consciousness.

If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",Organic nitriles are converted into cyanide ions through the action of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. Cyanide is rapidly absorbed and distributed throughout the body. Cyanide is mainly metabolized into thiocyanate by either rhodanese or 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase. Cyanide metabolites are excreted in the urine.

Bromine is a halogen element with the symbol Br and atomic number 35. Diatomic bromine does not occur naturally, but bromine salts can be found in crustal rock.

The bromide ion is also known to affect the central nervous system, causing bromism. This is believed to be a result of bromide ions substituting for chloride ions in the in actions of neurotransmitters and transport systems, thus affecting numerous synaptic processes. The main target organs of aluminum are the central nervous system and bone. Aluminum binds with dietary phosphorus and impairs gastrointestinal absorption of phosphorus. The decreased phosphate body burden results in osteomalacia (softening of the bones due to defective bone mineralization) and rickets. Aluminum's neurotoxicity is believed to involve several mechanisms. Changes in cytoskeletal protein functions as a results of altered phosphorylation, proteolysis, transport, and synthesis are believed to be one cause. Aluminum may induce neurobehavioral effects by affecting permeability of the blood-brain barrier, cholinergic activity, signal transduction pathways, lipid peroxidation, and impair neuronal glutamate nitric oxide-cyclic GMP pathway, as well as interfere with metabolism of essential trace elements because of similar coordination chemistries and consequent competitive interactions. It has been suggested that aluminum's interaction with estrogen receptors increases the expression of estrogen-related genes and thereby contributes to the progression of breast cancer (A235), but studies have not been able to establish a clear link between aluminum and increased risk of breast cancer (A15468). Certain aluminum salts induce immune responses by activating inflammasomes.

Due to its reactivity, bromine quickly forms bromide and may be deposited in the tissues, displacing other halogens. Aluminum is poorly absorbed following either oral or inhalation exposure and is essentially not absorbed dermally. The bioavailability of aluminum is strongly influenced by the aluminum compound and the presence of dietary constituents which can complex with aluminum and enhance or inhibit its absorption. Aluminum binds to various ligands in the blood and distributes to every organ, with highest concentrations found in bone and lung tissues. In living organisms, aluminum is believed to exist in four different forms: as free ions, as low-molecular-weight complexes, as physically bound macromolecular complexes, and as covalently bound macromolecular complexes. Absorbed aluminum is excreted principally in the urine and, to a lesser extent, in the bile, while unabsorbed aluminum is excreted in the faeces.

Most of the bromoform that enters the environment is formed as disinfection byproducts known as the trihalomethanes when chlorine is added to drinking water or swimming pools to kill bacteria. In the past, it was used as a solvent, sedative and flame retardant, but now it is mainly used as a laboratory reagent. Bromine is a halogen element with the symbol Br and atomic number 35.

It was used extensively as a pesticide and as a fire extinguisher component until being phased out by most countries in the early 2000s, as it is considered an ozone-depleting substance. The primary use of methyl bromide is/was as a fumigant in soil to control fungi, nematodes, and weeds; in space fumigation of food commodities (e.g., grains); and in storage facilities (such as mills, warehouses, vaults, ships, and freight cars) to control insects and rodents. Its popularity as a fumigant is largely attributable to its high toxicity to many pests, the variety of settings in which it can be applied, its ability to penetrate the fumigated substances, and its rapid dissipation following application. Trace amounts of methyl bromide have been detected in drinking water.  There are many reports of humans who have died following acute inhalation exposure to bromomethane. Most cases have involved accidental exposures associated with manufacturing or packaging operations, use of fire extinguishers containing bromomethane, or fumigation activities. Death is not immediate, but usually occurs within l-2 days of exposure. The cause of death is not certain, but is probably due to neurological and lung injury.",74-83-9,6323.0,CH3Br,93.94181,Colorless gas.,-93.7°C,,15.2 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L626) ; inhalation (L626) ; dermal (L626),"Organobromide compounds such as bromomethane are strong alkylating agents.  Consequently they can readily modify free thiols (cysteines) and methionine residues of the surfaces of proteins leading to the disruption of enzyme, transporter or membrane functions.

This is believed to be a result of bromide ions substituting for chloride ions in the in actions of neurotransmitters and transport systems, thus affecting numerous synaptic processes. (L626, L627, T104). However, the exact mechanism of toxicity for methyl bromide is currently uncertain, although its alkylating property as well as the reactive intermediates formed through metabolic transformation remain attractive hypotheses.","Bromomethane undergoes initial metabolism primarily by nucleophilic displacement of the bromide ion. When the attacking species is water, the products are methanol and bromide ion. Bromomethane may also react with organic thiols (R-SH) to yield S-methyl derivatives. This has been shown to result in formation of S-methylcysteine derivatives in hemoglobin of mice exposed to bromomethane. Further metabolism of methanol or S-methyl derivatives then leads to the formation of carbon dioxide.

In most places, levels of methyl bromide in the air are usually < 0.025 parts per billion (ppb).  Industrial areas have higher levels (ranging up to 1.2 ppb) because of releases from chemical factories. Workers who fumigate homes and fields may be exposed to high levels of methyl bromide if proper safety precautions are not followed.
",,Bromomethane is highly toxic. Studies in humans indicate that the lung may be severely injured by the acute (short-term) inhalation of bromomethane.  Acute and chronic (long-term) inhalation of bromomethane can lead to neurological effects in humans.  Neurological effects have also been reported in animals.  Degenerative and proliferative lesions in the nasal cavity developed in rats chronically exposed to bromomethane by inhalation.  Chronic inhalation exposure of male animals has resulted in effects on the testes at high concentrations. Studies in humans indicate that the lung may be most severely injured by the acute inhalation exposure of bromomethane.  The kidney is also sensitive to bromomethane. Anuria and proteinuria are common signs of renal injury in acutely exposed humans.,"Breathing modest amounts of bromomethane may lead to the development of a headache, nausea and weakness after several hours. Breathing high concentrations of bromomethane may cause pulmonary edema, impairing respiratory function. Acute exposure by inhalation of bromomethane frequently leads to neurological effects in humans.  Symptoms of acute exposure in humans include headaches, dizziness, fainting, apathy, weakness, confusion, speech impairment, visual effects, numbness, twitching, and tremors; in severe cases paralysis and convulsions are possible. Bromomethane is irritating to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract.  Dermal exposure to bromomethane can cause itching, redness, and blisters in humans. Neurological effects, including lethargy, forelimb twitching, tremors, and paralysis, have also been observed after chronic exposure to bromomethane.

Consequently they can randomly modify the surfaces of proteins and lipids, leading to the disruption of enzyme, transporter or membrane functions.  One of the most probable protein targets is the TRPA1 ion channel that is expressed in sensory nerves (trigeminal nerve) of the eyes, nose, mouth and lungs. Alkylation of DNA by alkylbromides may also lead to mutations. 2-bromopropane triggers the mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic pathway via ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation. 2-bromopropane has also been shown to induce DNA damage, impair functional antioxidant cellular defenses, and enhance the lipid peroxidation in cultured Leydig cells.",,"LD50: 4837 mg/kg (Intraperitoneal, Mouse) (T14)

Chronic exposure has been shown to have teratogenic effects in mouse and rat embryos.  Very high chronic doses led to developmental toxicity which included an increase in the fetal deaths, a decrease in the litter size, and a reduction in the fetal body weight. In addition, an increase in the incidence of fetal external, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities was seen. Chronic exposure to 2-bromopropane depletes spermatogenic cells in male rats and oocytes in female rats. Humans exposed to 2-bromopropane exhibited oligospermia, amenorrhea and other reproductive toxic effects.","May cause skin, eye and respiratory tract irritation. May affect behavior/central nervous system (central nervous system depression, excitement fatigue, headache, dizziness, stupor,unconsciousness and possible coma). If ingested, 2-bromopropane may cause gastrointestinal tract irritation with nausea, and vomiting. It may also affect behavior/central nervous system with symptoms similar to those for inhalation. May also cause kidney damage and liver damage.","EYES: irrigate opened eyes for several minutes under running water.

Consequently they can randomly modify the surfaces of proteins and lipids, leading to the disruption of enzyme, transporter or membrane functions.  Alkylation of DNA by alkylbromides may also lead to mutations. Vinyl bromide is metabolically activated by liver microsomal enzymes to intermediates that covalently bind to proteins and nucleic acids. Several lines of evidence suggest the involvement of the epoxides, i.e., bromoethylene oxide. Proven targets for alkylation are adenine, cytosine and guanine moieties in nucleic acids, and sulfhydryl groups of proteins. Vinylbromide reacts quickly with hepatic glutathione (GSH) leading to its rapid depletion and subsequent liver damage.","Bromine is mainly absorbed via inhalation, but may also enter the body through dermal contact. Bromine salts can be ingested. Due to its reactivity, bromine quickly forms bromide and may be deposited in the tissues, displacing other halogens.

Acute exposure of rats to very high concentrations via inhalation has resulted in liver and kidney damage and adverse neurological effects.

1544.0,1843.0,T3D1839,Sodium selenite,"Sodium selenite is a chemical compound of sodium and selenium. It is the most common water-soluble form of selenium. Together with the related barium and zinc salts, sodium selenite is mainly used in the manufacture of colorless glass. Its pink coloration cancels out the green color imparted by iron impurities. Selenium is a nonmetal element with the atomic number 34 and the chemical symbol Se. Selenium rarely occurs in its elemental state in nature and is usually found in sulfide ores such as pyrite, partially replacing the sulfur in the ore matrix. It may also be found in silver, copper, lead, and nickel minerals. Though selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, trace amounts of the element are necessary for cellular function in most animals, forming the active center of the enzymes glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, and three known deiodinase enzymes.

Inactivation of the sulfhydryl enzymes necessary for oxidative reactions in cellular respiration, through effects on mitochondrial and microsomal electron transport, might contribute to acute selenium toxicity. Selenomethionine (a common organic selenium compound) also appears to randomly substitute for methionine in protein synthesis. This substitution may affect the structure and functionability of the protein, for example, by altering disulfide bridges. Inorganic forms of selenium appear to react with tissue thiols by redox catalysis, resulting in formation of reactive oxygen species and causing damage by oxidative stress. (L619)","Selenium may be absorbed through inhalation and ingestion, while some selenium compounds may also be absorbed dermally. Once in the body, selenium is distributed mainly to the liver and kidney. Selenium is an essential micronutrient and is a component of glutathione peroxidase, iodothyronine 5'-deiodinases, and thioredoxin reductase. Organic selenium is first metabolized into inorganic selenium. Inorganic selenium is reduced stepwise to the intermediate hydrogen selenide, which is either incorporated into selenoproteins after being transformed to selenophosphate and selenocysteinyl tRNA or excreted into the urine after being transformed into methylated metabolites of selenide. Elemental selenium is also methylated before excretion. Selenium is primarily eliminated in the urine and feces, but certain selenium compounds may also be exhaled.

1547.0,1846.0,T3D1842,m-Cresol,"m-Cresol is an isomer of p-cresol and o-cresol. Cresols are organic compounds which are methylphenols. They are a widely occurring natural and manufactured group of aromatic organic compounds which are categorized as phenols (sometimes called phenolics). Depending on the temperature, cresols can be solid or liquid because they have melting points not far from room temperature. Like other types of phenols, they are slowly oxidized by long exposure to air and the impurities often give cresols a yellowish to brownish red tint. Cresols have an odor characteristic to that of other simple phenols, reminiscent to some of a medicine smell. Cresol solutions are used as household cleaners and disinfectants, perhaps most famously under the trade name Lysol. In the past, cresol solutions have been used as antiseptics in surgery, but they have been largely displaced in this role by less toxic compounds. Lysol was also advertised as a disinfecting vaginal douche in mid-twentieth century America. Cresols are found in many foods and in wood and tobacco smoke, crude oil, coal tar, and in brown mixtures such as creosote and cresylic acids, which are wood preservatives. Small organisms in soil and water produce cresols when they break down materials in the environment. Most exposures to cresols are at very low levels that are not harmful. When cresols are breathed, ingested, or applied to the skin at very high levels, they can be very harmful. Effects observed in people include irritation and burning of skin, eyes, mouth, and throat; abdominal pain and vomiting; heart damage; anemia; liver and kidney damage; facial paralysis; coma; and death. Breathing high levels of cresols for a short time results in irritation of the nose and throat. Aside from these effects, very little is known about the effects of breathing cresols, for example, at lower levels over longer times. Ingesting high levels results in kidney problems, mouth and throat burns, abdominal pain, vomiting, and effects on the blood and nervous system. Skin contact with high levels of cresols can burn the skin and damage the kidneys, liver, blood, brain, and lungs.

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Cresols can be absorbed following inhalation, oral, and dermal exposure. Once in the body they can distribute rapidly into many organs and tissues. Cresols undergo oxidative metabolism in the liver and are rapidly eliminated, mostly in the urine, as sulfate or glucuronide conjugates. The activation of cresols by oxidation involves tyrosinase and thyroid peroxidase, forming a reactive quinone methide. Experiments with recombinant P-450s demonstrated cresol metabolism was mediated by several P-450s including CYP2D6, 2C19, 1A2, 1A1, and 2E1.

They may be formed normally in the body from other compounds. Cresols are found in many foods and in wood and tobacco smoke, crude oil, coal tar, and in chemical mixtures used as wood preservatives. Small organisms in soil and water produce cresols when they break down materials in the environment. Breathing air containing cresols is the primary source of exposure. Exposure may also result from drinking contaminated water, eating contaminated food and coming into contact with liquids containing cresols. (L528)  ","Intermediate Oral: 0.1 mg/kg/day (L134) 
Chronic Oral: 0.1 mg/kg/day (L134)","Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Ingestion of cresols results in burning of the mouth and throat, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Inhalation or dermal exposure to cresols can produce irritation and corrosion at the site of contact.

If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

Products containing bifenthrin include Talstar, Capture, Brigade, Bifenthrine, Ortho Home Defense Max, and Scotts LawnPro Step 3. The Bifenthrin Molecule, a 4th generation pyrethroid, was discovered and developed by FMC Corporation Pty Ltd it. Bifenthrin is virtually insoluble in water with a solubility of 0.1 mg/l. Given its low solubility, bifenthrin has high persistence in soil (half life = 7 days - 8 months) and consequently it is the longest residual termiticide currently registered on the market today.  A pyrethroid is a synthetic chemical compound similar to the natural chemical pyrethrins produced by the flowers of pyrethrums (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and C. coccineum). Pyrethroids are common in commercial products such as household insecticides and insect repellents. In the concentrations used in such products, they are generally harmless to human beings but can harm sensitive individuals. They are usually broken apart by sunlight and the atmosphere in one or two days, and do not significantly affect groundwater quality except for being toxic to fish.

They appear to bind to the membrane lipid phase in the immediate vicinity of the sodium channel, thus modifying the channel kinetics. This blocks the closing of the sodium gates in the nerves, and thus prolongs the return of the membrane potential to its resting state. The repetitive (sensory, motor) neuronal discharge and a prolonged negative afterpotential produces effects quite similar to those produced by DDT, leading to hyperactivity of the nervous system which can result in paralysis and/or death. Other mechanisms of action of pyrethroids include antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, modulation of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, enhancement of noradrenaline release, and actions on calcium ions.

1550.0,1850.0,T3D1846,Fenpropathrin,"Fenpropathrin is a pyrethroid (type 1) insecticide. A pyrethroid is a synthetic chemical compound similar to the natural chemical pyrethrins produced by the flowers of pyrethrums (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and C. coccineum). Pyrethroids are common in commercial products such as household insecticides and insect repellents. In the concentrations used in such products, they are generally harmless to human beings but can harm sensitive individuals. They are usually broken apart by sunlight and the atmosphere in one or two days, and do not significantly affect groundwater quality except for being toxic to fish. Insects with certain mutations in their sodium channel gene may be resistant to pyrethroid insecticides.

(1990)]",Inhalation  (L857) ; oral  (L857) ; dermal  (L857) ; eye contact (L857).,"Pyrethroids exert their effect by prolonging the open phase of the sodium channel gates when a nerve cell is excited. They appear to bind to the membrane lipid phase in the immediate vicinity of the sodium channel, thus modifying the channel kinetics. This blocks the closing of the sodium gates in the nerves, and thus prolongs the return of the membrane potential to its resting state. The repetitive (sensory, motor) neuronal discharge and a prolonged negative afterpotential produces effects quite similar to those produced by DDT, leading to hyperactivity of the nervous system which can result in paralysis and/or death. Other mechanisms of action of pyrethroids include antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, modulation of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, enhancement of noradrenaline release, and actions on calcium ions. (T18, L857)","Fenpropathrin has been shown to be well absorbed after oral administration, extensively metabolized, and eliminated as polar conjugates in urine.  The main route of metabolism was, as anticipated, via hydrolysis of the ester linkage. The cyclopropane-carboxylic acid moiety was subsequently excreted via the urine as  the glucuronide conjugate.

At lower doses, commonly observed effects include paresthesia and erythema. (L863)","Following dermal exposure to fenpropathrin, feelings of numbness, itching, burning, stinging, tingling, or warmth may occur, that could last for a few hours. Dizziness, headache, nausea, muscle twitching, reduced energy, and changes in awareness can result from inhalation or ingestion of large amounts of fenpropathrine. Paralysis can occur after exposure.

If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids. In case of eye exposure, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes.

Pyrethroids are common in commercial products such as household insecticides and insect repellents. In the concentrations used in such products, they are generally harmless to human beings but can harm sensitive individuals. They are usually broken apart by sunlight and the atmosphere in one or two days, and do not significantly affect groundwater quality except for being toxic to fish. Insects with certain mutations in their sodium channel gene may be resistant to pyrethroid insecticides.

They appear to bind to the membrane lipid phase in the immediate vicinity of the sodium channel, thus modifying the channel kinetics. This blocks the closing of the sodium gates in the nerves, and thus prolongs the return of the membrane potential to its resting state. The repetitive (sensory, motor) neuronal discharge and a prolonged negative afterpotential produces effects quite similar to those produced by DDT, leading to hyperactivity of the nervous system which can result in paralysis and/or death. Other mechanisms of action of pyrethroids include antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, modulation of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, enhancement of noradrenaline release, and actions on calcium ions. (T18, L857)","The major metabolic pathways are cleavage of ester linkage and oxidation at the acid and alcohol moieties. Ester hydrolysis leads to formation of anilino acid. The anilino acid is further conjugated with amino acids (glycine, serine, threonine, and valine), bile acids (cholic, taurochoric, and taurochenodeoxycholic), and glycerols (oleoyl- and linoleoylglycerol). In addition, an amide derivative of anilino acid was found. These conjugation reactions of anilino acid with bile acid (cholic acid, taurocholic acid, and taurochenodeoxycholic acid) and with glycerol and monoglycerides have rarely been reported as conjugates with xenobiotics. The major urinary metabolites are anilino acid, its hydroxymethyl derivative, its glycine conjugate, haloaniline, and sulfate conjugate of hydroxyhaloaniline. On the other hand, the major fecal metabolites are anilino acid, its amide derivative, and several conjugates of anilino acid with several endogenous components. An unexpected difference between fluvalinate and other pyrethroids is the minimal amount of hydroxylation at the 4'-position of the alcohol moiety. (T80)","LD50: 282 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L886)

Dizziness, headache, nausea, muscle twitching, reduced energy, and changes in awareness can result from inhalation or ingestion of large amounts of tau-fluvalinate. Paralysis can occur after exposure. (L857)","Following oral exposure, the treatment is symptomatic and supportive and includes monitoring for the development of hypersensitivity reactions with respiratory distress.

Repeated irritation results in a hyperplastic response in the target tissues. The mutagenicity of cis-1,3-dichloropropene is attributed to its biotransformation by cytochrome P-450 to stereospecific epoxides and the hydrolysis product, 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropanal. It is likely that depletion of glutathione would block the major detoxification pathway for cis-1,3- dichloropropene, resulting in increased toxicity of organs such as the liver and kidney because of binding of reactive intermediates to macromolecules in cells. There is some evidence that cytotoxicity of hepatic cells exposed to cis-1,3-dichloropropene is preceded by increased levels of phospholipid hydroperoxides (L893).","The major metabolic pathway is rapid conjugation with glutathione, resulting in theformation of a mercapturic acid metabolite that is excreted in the urine. Cis-1,3-Dichoropropene may alsoundergo hydrolysis and dechlorination to form 1-chloroallyl alcohol, an intermediate that reacts withalcohol dehydrogenase to form 1-chloroacrolein. Another minor pathway involves reaction withcytochrome P450 to form mutagenic cis and trans epoxides that convert to the mutagen 3-chloro2-hydroxy-propanal. Conjugation with glutathione can occur in the nasal tissue, kidney, and liver.

Like other perchlorates, this salt is a strong oxidizer and reacts with many organic substances. It is usually obtained as a colorless, crystalline powder. It is one of the most common oxidizers used in fireworks, ammunition percussion caps, explosive primers, and is used variously in propellants, flash compositions, stars, and sparklers. It has been used as a solid rocket propellant, although in that application it has mostly been replaced by the higher performance ammonium perchlorate. KClO4 has the lowest solubility of the alkali metal perchlorates (1.5 g in 100 g of water at 25 ",7778-74-7,516900.0,ClKO4,137.91222,Colourless/white crystalline powder (L896).,525°C,,"15 mg/mL at 25°C [ASHFORD,RD (1994)]",Inhalation (L894) ; oral (L894) ; dermal (L894) ;  eye contact (L894).,"The primary and most sensitive target of the perchlorate anion (perchlorate) is the thyroid gland. Perchlorate inhibits the transport of iodide (I-) from the blood into the thyroid follicle cells. The inhibition is thought to be accomplished by perchlorate competitively blocking iodide binding to a carrier, or sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), which catalyzes the simultaneous transfer of Na+ and I-across the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicle cells. Perchlorate inhibition of the NIS can limit the availability of iodide needed for the production of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which in turn, may affect the circulating levels of T4 and T3. All known effects of perchlorate on the thyroid hormone system derive directly or secondarily from the inhibition of the NIS. T3 is essential for normal development of the nervous system and for the regulation of metabolism of cells in nearly all tissues of the body. Disruption in the availability of T3 in target tissues can result in adverse effects on a wide variety of organs and systems (L894).",There is no evidence that potasssium perchlorate is metabolized in the body.

Organ systems affected by disturbances in T3 levels include the skin, cardiovascular system, pulmonary system, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, liver, blood, neuromuscular system, central nervous system, skeleton, male and female reproductive systems, and numerous endocrine organs, including the pituitary and adrenal glands. Such an array of secondary potential targets underscores the need to maintain an adequate level of circulating thyroid hormones. Perchlorate, an environmental contaminant, is known to disturb the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis by blocking iodide accumulation in the thyroid. Iodide deficiency can lead to hypothyroidism and goiter (L894, A267). ","Irritating to skin, eyes, and respiratory system, depending on the route of exposure. Esophageal or gastrointestinal tract irritation could occur following exposures (L894).","In case of oral exposure, immediately dilute with 4 to 8 ounces (120 to 240 mol) of water or milk.

Protect airway by placement in Trendelenburg and left lateral decubitus position or by endotracheal intubation. Control any seizures first.  Maintain ventilation and oxygenation and evaluate with frequent arterial blood gas or pulse oximetry monitoring. Early use of PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be needed. Following inhalation, Move patient to fresh air. Monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids.

Like other perchlorates, it is a powerful oxidizer. It is produced by reaction between ammonia and perchloric acid, or by double decomposition between an ammonium salt and sodium perchlorate. It crystallises in colorless rhombohedra with a relative density of 1.95. Like most ammonium salts, it decomposes before melting. Mild heating results in chlorine, nitrogen, oxygen and water, while strong heating may lead to explosions (L897).",7790-98-9,24639.0,ClH4NO4,116.98288,white granular (L897),Exothermic decomposition before melting at &gt;200°C [ 1 ],,"200 mg/mL at 25°C [ASHFORD,RD (1994)]",Inhalation (L894) ; oral (L894) ; dermal (L894) ;  eye contact (L894).,"The primary and most sensitive target of the perchlorate anion (perchlorate) is the thyroid gland. Perchlorate inhibits the transport of iodide (I-) from the blood into the thyroid follicle cells. The inhibition is thought to be accomplished by perchlorate competitively blocking iodide binding to a carrier, or sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), which catalyzes the simultaneous transfer of Na+ and I-across the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicle cells. Perchlorate inhibition of the NIS can limit the availability of iodide needed for the production of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which in turn, may affect the circulating levels of T4 and T3. All known effects of perchlorate on the thyroid hormone system derive directly or secondarily from the inhibition of the NIS. T3 is essential for normal development of the nervous system and for the regulation of metabolism of cells in nearly all tissues of the body. Disruption in the availability of T3 in target tissues can result in adverse effects on a wide variety of organs and systems (L894).",There is no evidence that ammonium perchlorate is metabolized in the body.

Such an array of secondary potential targets underscores the need to maintain an adequate level of circulating thyroid hormones.

Muscimol actually binds to the same binding site on the GABAA receptor complex as GABA itself, as opposed to other GABAergic drugs such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines which bind to separate regulatory sites. GABAA receptors are widely distributed in the brain, and so when muscimol is administered, it alters neuronal activity in multiple regions including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. However while muscimol is conventionally thought of as a selective GABAA agonist, it is also a potent partial agonist at the GABAC receptor, and so its effects profile results from a combined action at both targets.

It is present in hundreds of species of fungi, including those of the genus Psilocybe, such as Psilocybe cubensis and Psilocybe semilanceata, but also reportedly isolated from a dozen or so other genera. Psilocybin mushrooms are commonly called ""sacred mushrooms,"" ""magic mushrooms,"" or more simply ""shrooms"". Possession, and in some cases usage, of psilocybin or psilocin has been outlawed in most countries across the globe. Proponents of its usage consider it to be an entheogen and a tool to supplement various types of practices for transcendence, including in meditation, psychonautics, and psychedelic psychotherapy. The intensity and duration of entheogenic effects of psilocybin mushrooms are highly variable, depending on species/cultivar of mushrooms, dosage, individual physiology, and set and setting. Though psilocybin rarely attracts much attention from mainstream media, when it does the focus tends to be on the recreational use, generally excluding any other uses of the drug.

Psilocin is an 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/2C agonist. (L1143),Psilocybin is rapidly dephosphorylated in the body to psilocin. Psilocybin is metabolized mostly in the liver where it becomes psilocin.

At low doses, hallucinatory effects may occur, including enhancement of colors and the animation of geometric shapes. Closed-eye hallucination may occur, where the affected individual may see multi-coloured geometric shapes and vivid imaginative sequences. At higher doses, hallucinatory effects increase and experiences tend to be less social and more introspective or entheogenic.

The anti-inflammatory action of the drug is unrelated to its antibacterial action and is still not fully understood.","Dapsone is slowly and nearly completely absporbed from GI tract, and distributed throughout the body. It is acetylated in the liver to monoacetyl and diacetyl derivatives. The major metabolite of dapsone is monoacetyldapsone. The rate of acetylation of dapsone is genetically determined and is subject to interindividual variation, although the rate is usually constant for each individual. The drug also is hydroxylated in the liver to hydroxylamine dapsone (NOH-DDS). NOH-DDS appears to be responsible for methemoglobinemia and hemolysis induced by the drug.

This is the first drug that was specifically approved to help with mobility in these patients. FDA approved on January 22, 2010. 4-Aminopyridine is an organic compound with the formula H2NC5H4N. The molecule is one of the three isomeric amines of pyridine. 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) is prepared by the decarbonylation of pyridine-4-carboxyamide using sodium hypochlorite via the Hofmann rearrangement (L1082).",504-24-5,1727.0,C5H6N2,94.0531,Colourless solid (L1082).,157-161°C,273°C,74 g/L,"Inhalation (T52, T14) ; oral (T52, T14) ; dermal (T52, T14) ; intravenous (T52, T14)Orally-administered dalfampridine is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Tmax, immediate release form = 1 hour;Tmax, extended release form = 3.5 hours;Cmax, 10 mg extended release = 17.3 - 21.6 ng/mL; Relative bioavailability of 10 mg extended-release tablets compared to aqueous oral solution = 96%","4-Aminopyridine blocks potassium channels and thereby increases acetylcholine, and possibly noradrenaline, release at nerve terminals (A316). In MS, axons are progressively demyelinated which exposes potassium channels. As a result, there is a leak of potassium ions which results in the repolarization of cells and a decrease in neuronal excitability. The overall impact is the impairment of neuromuscular transmission as it is harder to trigger an action potential. Dalfampridine inhibits voltage-gated potassium channels in the CNS to maintain the transmembrane potential and prolong action potential. In other words, dalfampridine works to make sure that the current available is high enough to stimulate conduction in demyelinated axons that are exposed in MS patients. Furthermore, it facilitates neuromuscular and synaptic transmission by relieving conduction blocks in demyelinated axons.","Not extensively metabolized by the liver therefore drugs effecting the cytochrome P450 enzyme system that are concomitantly administered with dalfampridine are not expected to interact with each other. 4-Aminopyridine is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract. It is readily broken down, or metabolized, in the liver into removable compounds excreted in urine. After intravenous and oral absoprtion, the metabolites  were almost all excreted in the urine. It does not to concentrate or accumulate in skin. 4-Aminopyridine is excreted in urine and rapidly detoxified in the liver (T48, L1090). Metabolites include 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine and 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine sulfate and both are inactive. CYP2E1 is the enzyme responsible for 3-hydroxylation of dalfampridine. Route of Elimination: Almost all of the dose and its metabolites are completely eliminated by the kidneys after 24 hours. Urine (96%; 90% of total dose as unchanged drug);Feces (0.5%) Half Life: Immediate release form = 3.5 hours;Extended release form = 5.47 hours;  ","LD50, oral, mouse = 19 mg/kgLD50, oral, rat = 21 mg/kgLD50: 20-29 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L1090)LD50: 3.7 mg/kg (Oral, Dog) (L1090)LD50: 326 mg/kg (Dermal, Rabbit) (L1090)",,No indication of carcinogenicity to humans (not listed by IARC).,"Dalfampridine is a neurofunctional modifier that helps improve walking speed in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Following inhalation, move patient to fresh air and monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation,  bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids. In case of eye exposure, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. If the exposure occurs through dermal exposure, remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed area thoroughly with soap and water. (T36)

2096.0,2616.0,T3D2575,Tramadol,"A narcotic analgesic proposed for moderate to severe pain. It may be habituating. Tramadol is also prepared as a variable release capsules, marketed under the brand name ConZip. For example, a 150 mg capsule will contain 37.5 mg of the immediate release form and 112.5 mg of the extended release form. Tramadol is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a narcotic analgesic proposed for moderate to severe pain. It may be habituating. Tramadol and its O-desmethyl metabolite (M1) are selective, weak OP3-receptor agonists. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. The analgesic properties of Tramadol can be attributed to norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake blockade in the CNS, which inhibits pain transmission in the spinal cord. The (+) enantiomer has higher affinity for the OP3 receptor and preferentially inhibits serotonin uptake and enhances serotonin release. The (-) enantiomer preferentially inhibits norepinephrine reuptake by stimulating alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors.",27203-92-5,33741.0,C16H25NO2,263.18853,Solid (A308).,180-181°C,,Soluble,"Inhalation.Racemic tramadol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration.

The major metabolic pathways appear to be N- and O- demethylation and glucuronidation or sulfation in the liver. One metabolite (O-desmethyltramadol, denoted M1) is pharmacologically active in animal models. CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 facilitates the biotransformation of tramadol to N-desmethyl-tramadol. CYP2D6 facilitates the biotransformation of tramadol to O-desmethyl-tramadol.  Racemic tramadol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. The mean absolute bioavailability of a 100 mg oral dose is approximately 75%.The mean peak plasma concentration of racemic tramadol and M1 occurs at two and three hours, respectively, after administration in healthy adults. Tramadol undergoes hepatic metabolism via the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2D6, being O- and N-demethylated to five different metabolites. Of these, M1 (O-Desmethyltramadol) is the most significant since it has 200 times the affinity of (+)-tramadol, and furthermore has an elimination half-life of nine hours, compared with six hours for tramadol itself. In the 6% of the population that have slow CYP2D6 activity, there is therefore a slightly reduced analgesic effect. Phase II hepatic metabolism renders the metabolites water-soluble, which are excreted by the kidneys. Thus, reduced doses may be used in renal and hepatic impairment (A308, L1160).Route of Elimination: Tramadol is eliminated primarily through metabolism by the liver and the metabolites are excreted primarily by the kidneys. Approximately 30% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, whereas 60% of the dose is excreted as metabolites.Half Life: Tramadol and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine with observed plasma half-lives of 6.3 and 7.4 hours for tramadol and M1, respectively.","LD50: 300-350 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (A2833)",,No indication of carcinogenicity to humans (not listed by IARC).,"Indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe pain.

The respiratory depressant effects include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in these patients (RxList, A308).

The fluorine substituted acetate becomes incorporated, as a normal acetate, into fluoroacetyl coenzyme A, which condenses with oxaloacetate to form fluorocitrate. Fluorocitrate inhibits the enzyme aconitase and thereby inhibits the conversion of citrate to isocitrate. As a result there is an accumulation of large quantities of citrate in the tissue, and the cycle is blocked. The heart and CNS are the most critical tissues involved in poisoning by general inhibition of oxydative energy metabolism (A640).",Fluoroacetamide is metabolized by the fluoroacetate specific dehalogenase (A323). ,"LD50: 4-15 mg/kg  (Oral, Rat) (A640)

2195.0,2754.0,T3D2712,Caffeine,"Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychostimulant drug in the world that mostly is consumed in the form of coffee. Whether caffeine and/or coffee consumption contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the single leading cause of death in the US, is unclear. The literature indicates a strong relationship between boiled, unfiltered coffee consumption and elevated cholesterol levels; however, there is a critical gap in the literature regarding the effects of coffee or caffeine consumption on fibrinogen or CRP, which is an independent predictor of CVD risk. Available studies are limited by small samples sizes, inclusion of only men (or few women) and unrepresented age or ethnic groups. There is a critical need for controlled laboratory and epidemiological studies that include fibrinogen and CRP markers of CVD risk before conclusions can be drawn regarding the health effects of caffeine and/or coffee in a normal, healthy population of men and women. (A11723). The relationship between caffeine consumption and various illnesses such as cardiovascular disease and cancer remains equivocal. Prudence might dictate that pregnant women and chronically ill individuals exercise restraint in their use of caffeine, although research suggests relatively low or nonexistent levels of risk associated with moderate caffeine consumption. (A7827). There is extensive evidence that caffeine at dietary doses increases blood pressure (BP). However, concern that the drug may contribute to cardiovascular disease appears to have been dampened by (1) the belief that habitual use leads to the development of tolerance, and (2) confusion regarding relevant epidemiologic findings. When considered comprehensively, findings from experimental and epidemiologic studies converge to show that BP remains reactive to the pressor effects of caffeine in the diet. Overall, the impact of dietary caffeine on population BP levels is likely to be modest, probably in the region of 4/2 mm Hg. At these levels, however, population studies of BP indicate that caffeine use could account for premature deaths in the region of 14% for coronary heart disease and 20% for stroke. (A7828). Caffeine is a purine alkaloid that occurs naturally in coffee beans. At intake levels associated with coffee consumption, caffeine appears to exert most of its biological effects through the antagonism of the A1 and A2A subtypes of the adenosine receptor. Adenosine is an endogenous neuromodulator with mostly inhibitory effects, and adenosine antagonism by caffeine results in effects that are generally stimulatory. Some physiological effects associated with caffeine administration include central nervous system stimulation, acute elevation of blood pressure, increased metabolic rate, and diuresis. Caffeine concentrations in coffee beverages can be quite variable. A standard cup of coffee is often assumed to provide 100 mg of caffeine, but a recent analysis of 14 different specialty coffees purchased at coffee shops in the US found that the amount of caffeine in 8 oz (=240 ml) of brewed coffee ranged from 72 to 130 mg.Caffeine in espresso coffees ranged from 58 to 76 mg in a single shot. (A7829). Caffeine is a member of the methylxanthine family of drugs, and is the most widely consumed behaviourally active substance in the western world. A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that caffeine modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses. For instance studies indicate that caffeine and its major metabolite paraxanthine suppress neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis, and also suppress production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha from human blood. Caffeine has also been reported to suppress human lymphocyte function as indicated by reduced T-cell proliferation and impaired production of Th1 (interleukin [IL]-2 and interferon [IFN]-gamma), Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) and Th3 (IL-10) cytokines. Studies also indicate that caffeine suppresses antibody production. The evidence suggests that at least some of the immunomodulatory actions of caffeine are mediated via inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-phosphodiesterase (PDE), and consequential increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations. Overall, these studies indicate that caffeine, like other members of the methylxanthine family, is largely anti-inflammatory in nature, and based on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, many of its immunomodulatory effects occur at concentrations that are relevant to normal human consumption. (A7830).",58-08-2,2519.0,C8H10N4O2,194.08038,White powder.,238°C,,2.16E+004 mg/L (at 25°C),Readily absorbed after oral or parenteral administration. The peak plasma level for caffeine range from 6-10mg/L and the mean time to reach peak concentration ranged from 30 minutes to 2 hours.,"Caffeine stimulates medullary, vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers, promoting bradycardia, vasoconstriction, and increased respiratory rate. This action was previously believed to be due primarily to increased intracellular cyclic 3&prime;,5&prime;-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) following inhibition of phosphodiesterase, the enzyme that degrades cyclic AMP. It is now thought that xanthines such as caffeine act as antagonists at adenosine-receptors within the plasma membrane of virtually every cell. As adenosine acts as an autocoid, inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic sites but augmenting the actions of norepinephrine or angiotensin, antagonism of adenosine receptors promotes neurotransmitter release. This explains the stimulatory effects of caffeine. Blockade of the adenosine A1 receptor in the heart leads to the accelerated, pronounced ""pounding"" of the heart upon caffeine intake.","Hepatic cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP 1A2) is involved in caffeine biotransformation. About 80% of a dose of caffeine is metabolized to paraxanthine (1,7-dimethylxanthine), 10% to theobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine), and 4% to theophylline (1,3-dimethylxanthine).Route of Elimination: In young infants, the elimination of caffeine is much slower than that in adults due to immature hepatic and/or renal function.Half Life: 3 to 7 hours in adults, 65 to 130 hours in neonates","LD50: 127 mg/kg (Oral, Mouse) (A308)",,"3, not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans.

2258.0,2847.0,T3D2805,Duloxetine,"Duloxetine (brand names Cymbalta, Yentreve, and in parts of Europe, Xeristar or Ariclaim) is a drug which primarily targets major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), pain related to diabetic peripheral neuropathy and in some countries stress urinary incontinence (SUI). It is manufactured and marketed by Eli Lilly and Company.Duloxetine has not yet been FDA approved for stress urinary incontinence or for fibromyalgia.Duloxetine is a selective SNRI (selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor). Duloxetine is a systemic drug therapy which affects the body as a whole. Known also under the code name LY248686, it is a potent dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE), possessing comparable affinities in binding to NE- and 5-HT transporter sites. It is a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake.",136434-34-9,60835.0,C18H19NOS,297.11874,White powder.,,,2.96e-03 g/L,Orally administered duloxetine hydrochloride is well absorbed.,"Duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors. The antidepressant and pain inhibitory actions of duloxetine are believed to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS. The mechanism of action of duloxetine in SUI has not been determined, but is thought to be associated with the potentiation of serotonin and norepinephrine activity in the spinal cord, which increases urethral closure forces and thereby reduces involuntary urine loss.","The major biotransformation pathways for duloxetine involve oxidation of the naphthyl ring followed by conjugation and further oxidation. Both CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 catalyze the oxidation of the naphthyl ring in vitro. Metabolites found in plasma include 4-hydroxy duloxetine glucuronide and 5-hydroxy, 6-methoxy duloxetine sulfate. The major circulating metabolites have not been shown to contribute significantly to the pharmacologic activity of duloxetine.Route of Elimination: Many additional metabolites have been identified in urine, some representing only minor pathways of elimination. Most (about 70%) of the duloxetine dose appears in the urine as metabolites of duloxetine; about 20% is excreted in the feces.Half Life: 12 hours (range 8-17 hours)","Oral, rat LD<sub>50</sub>: 491 mg/kg for males and 279 mg/kg for females (A308).

Has been used in the management of moderate to severe stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women.",,,"Symptoms of overdose include tremors, convulsions, reduced activity, slow pupillary response, intermittent tremors, and rigidity.","There is no specific antidote to Duloxetine, but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment (such as with cyproheptadine and/or temperature control) may be considered. In case of acute overdose, treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdose with any drug. An adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation should be assured, and cardiac rhythm and vital signs should be monitored. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption of duloxetine from the gastrointestinal tract. Administration of activated charcoal has been shown to decrease AUC and Cmax by an average of one-third, although some subjects had a limited effect of activated charcoal. Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be beneficial.

2283.0,2883.0,T3D2841,Nicotinic acid,"Nicotinic acid, also known as niacin or vitamin B3, is a water-soluble vitamin whose derivatives such as NADH, NAD, NAD+, and NADP play essential roles in energy metabolism in the living cell and DNA repair. The designation vitamin B3 also includes the amide form, nicotinamide or niacinamide. Severe lack of niacin causes the deficiency disease pellagra, whereas a mild deficiency slows down the metabolism decreasing cold tolerance. The recommended daily allowance of niacin is 2-12 mg a day for children, 14 mg a day for women, 16 mg a day for men, and 18 mg a day for pregnant or breast-feeding women. It is found in various animal and plant tissues and has pellagra-curative, vasodilating, and antilipemic properties. The liver can synthesize niacin from the essential amino acid tryptophan (see below), but the synthesis is extremely slow and requires vitamin B6; 60 mg of tryptophan are required to make one milligram of niacin.

Niacin is the precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are vital cofactors for dozens of enzymes. The mechanism by which niacin exerts its lipid lowering effects is not entirely understood, but may involve several actions, including a decrease in esterification of hepatic triglycerides. Niacin treatment also decreases the serum levels of apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B), the major protein component of the VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) and LDL fractions.","Niacin is rapidly metabolized and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. The drug is converted to several metabolites, including nicotinuric acid (NUA), nicotinamide, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). At doses used to treat hyperlipoproteinemia, the principal metabolic pathways appear to be saturable, and niacin is thought to exhibit nonlinear, dose-dependent pharmacokinetics.

Niacin is also used as a pharmaceutical to reverse atherosclerosis. (A729)",,"Niacin at extremely high doses can have life-threatening acute toxic reactions. Extremely high doses of niacin can also cause niacin maculopathy, a thickening of the macula and retina which leads to blurred vision and blindness. This maculopathy is reversible after stopping niacin intake. Side effects of hyperglycemia, cardiac arrhythmias and birth defects have also been reported. (A729)","Nicotinic acid can cause vasodilation of cutaneous blood vessels resulting in increased blood flow, principally in the face, neck and chest. This produces the niacin- or nicotinic acid-flush. The niacin-flush is thought to be mediated via the prostaglandin prostacyclin. Histamine may also play a role in the niacin-flush. Flushing is the adverse reaction first observed after intake of a large dose of nicotinic acid, and the most bothersome one. ",Supportive measures should be undertaken in the event of an overdose.

It is used in dentistry, cardiac surgery, endoscopic procedures, as preanesthetic medication, and as an adjunct to local anesthesia. The short duration and cardiorespiratory stability makes it useful in poor-risk, elderly, and cardiac patients.  It is water-soluble at pH less than 4 and lipid-soluble at physiological pH.

","It is thought that the actions of benzodiazepines such as midazolam are mediated through the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain. Benzodiazepines increase the activity of GABA, thereby producing a calming effect, relaxing skeletal muscles, and inducing sleep. Benzodiazepines act as agonists at the benzodiazepine receptors, which form a component of the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor-chloride ionophore complex. Most anxiolytics appear to act through at least one component of this complex to enhance the inhibitory action of GABA.","Midazolam is primarily metabolized in the liver and gut by human cytochrome P450 IIIA4 (CYP3A4) to its pharmacologic active metabolite, (alpha)-hydroxymidazolam (also known as 1-hydroxy-midazolam), and 4-hydroxymidazolam (makes up 5% or less of the biotransformation products). 1-hydroxy-midazolam is at least as potent as the parent compound and may contributed to the overall activity of midazolam. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the affinities of 1- and 4-hydroxy-midazolam for the benzodiazepine receptor are approximately 20% and 7%, respectively, relative to midazolam. It also undergoes N-glucuronidation via UGT1A4. Route of Elimination: Midazolam is primarily metabolized in the liver and gut by human cytochrome P450 IIIA4 (CYP3A4) to its pharmacologic active metabolite, alpha-hydroxymidazolam, followed by glucuronidation of the alpha-hydroxyl metabolite which is present in unconjugated and conjugated forms in human plasma. The alpha- hydroxymidazolam glucuronide is then excreted in urine. No significant amount of parent drug or metabolites is extractable from urine before beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase deconjugation, indicating that the urinary metabolites are excreted mainly as conjugates. The amount of midazolam excreted unchanged in the urine when given intravenously is less than 0.5%. 45% to 57% of the dose was excreted in the urine as 1-hydroxymethyl midazolam conjugate. Half Life: Intravenous, healthy adults = 1.8 to 6.4 hours (mean of 3 hours)","LD50: 825 mg/kg (Oral, Rat)",,No indication of carcinogenicity to humans (not listed by IARC).,"Intravenous midazolam is indicated for procedural sedation (often in combination with an opioid, such as fentanyl), for pre-op sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation of ventilated patients in critical care units. Oral midazolam is indicated for the short term treatment of moderately severe insomnia in patients who did not adequately react to other hypnotics, and who have persistent trouble in falling asleep.

2306.0,2910.0,T3D2868,Paroxetine,"Paroxetine hydrochloride and paroxetine mesylate belong to a class of antidepressant agents known as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Despite distinct structural differences between compounds in this class, SSRIs possess similar pharmacological activity. As with other antidepressant agents, several weeks of therapy may be required before a clinical effect is seen. SSRIs are potent inhibitors of neuronal serotonin reuptake. They have little to no effect on norepinephrine or dopamine reuptake and do not antagonize &alpha;- or &beta;-adrenergic, dopamine D<sub>2</sub> or histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors. During acute use, SSRIs block serotonin reuptake and increase serotonin stimulation of somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and terminal autoreceptors. Chronic use leads to desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and terminal autoreceptors. The overall clinical effect of increased mood and decreased anxiety is thought to be due to adaptive changes in neuronal function that leads to enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. Side effects include dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, sexual dysfunction and headache (see Toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects). Side effects generally occur during the first two weeks of therapy and are usually less severe and frequent than those observed with tricyclic antidepressants. Paroxetine hydrochloride and mesylate are considered therapeutic alternatives rather than generic equivalents by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); both agents contain the same active moiety (i.e. paroxetine), but are formulated as different salt forms. Clinical studies establishing the efficacy of paroxetine in various conditions were performed using paroxetine hydrochloride. Since both agents contain the same active moiety, the clinical efficacy of both agents is thought to be similar. Paroxetine may be used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety disorder (social phobia), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Paroxetine has the most evidence supporting its use for anxiety-related disorders of the SSRIs. It has the greatest anticholinergic activity of the agents in this class and compared to other SSRIs, paroxetine may cause greater weight gain, sexual dysfunction, sedation and constipation. ",61869-08-7,43815.0,C19H20FNO3,329.14272,White powder.,147-150°C (mesylate salt),,>1 g/mL (mesylate salt),"Paroxetine hydrochloride is slowly, but completely absorbed following oral administration. Paroxetine mesylate salt is also completely absorbed after oral dosing. The oral bioavailability appears to be low due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Paroxetine hydrochloride oral tablets and suspension are reportedly bioequivalent. Absorption of either salt form is not substantially affected by food. Peak concentrations of Brisbelle (mesylate salt) were reached at 6 hours (3 to 8 hours range). Steady state Cmax was 13.10 ng/mL. The steady state AUC (0-last) was 237 hr*ng/mL. Paroxetine mesylate generally follows non-linear pharmacokinetics because CYP2D6, the enzyme that is part responisible for paroxetine metabolism, is readily saturable. ","Paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake. Paroxetine likely inhibits the reuptake of serotonin at the neuronal membrane, enhances serotonergic neurotransmission by reducing turnover of the neurotransmitter, therefore it prolongs its activity at synaptic receptor sites and potentiates 5-HT in the CNS; paroxetine is more potent than both sertraline and fluoxetine in its ability to inhibit 5-HT reuptake. Compared to the tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs have dramatically decreased binding to histamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine receptors. The mechanism of action for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms is unknown. ","Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration, likely in the liver. The main metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily eliminated by the body. The predominant metabolites are glucuronic acid and sulfate conjugates. Paroxetine metabolites do not possess significant pharmacologic activity (less than 2% that of parent compound). Paroxetine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. Enzyme saturation appears to account for the nonlinear pharmacokinetics observed with increasing dose and duration of therapy. Route of Elimination: Approximately 64% of a 30 mg oral solution of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites. Approximately 36% of the dose was excreted in the feces (via bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as parent compound. Half Life: 21-24 hours","LD50: 500mg/kg (Oral, Mouse) (A308)",,No indication of carcinogenicity to humans (not listed by IARC).,"Labeled indications include: major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety disorder (social phobia), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

Brisdelle, which consists of paroxetine mesylate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (like hot flashes) associated with menopause. ",,,"Coma, dizziness, drowsiness, facial flushing, nausea, sweating, tremor, vomiting","Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal should be administered. Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit.

2307.0,2911.0,T3D2869,Procaine,"Procaine is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a local anesthetic of the ester type that has a slow onset and a short duration of action. It is mainly used for infiltration anesthesia, peripheral nerve block, and spinal block. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1016). [PubChem]Procaine acts mainly by inhibiting sodium influx through voltage gated sodium channels in the neuronal cell membrane of peripheral nerves.

2355.0,2976.0,T3D2934,Maprotiline,"Maprotiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant with similar pharmacological properties to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Similar to TCAs, maprotiline inhibits neuronal norepinephrine reuptake, possesses some anticholinergic activity, and does not affect monoamine oxidase activity. It differs from TCAs in that it does not appear to block serotonin reuptake. Maprotiline may be used to treat depressive affective disorders, including dysthymic disorder (depressive neurosis) and major depressive disorder. Maprotiline is effective at reducing symptoms of anxiety associated with depression. ",10262-69-8,4011.0,C20H23N,277.18305,White powder.,93°C,,Slightly soluble,"Slowly, but completely absorbed from the GI tract following oral administration. ","Maprotiline exerts its antidepressant action by inhibition of presynaptic uptake of catecholamines, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain. In single doses, the effect of maprotiline on the EEG revealed a rise in the alpha-wave density, a reduction of the alpha-wave frequency and an increase in the alpha-wave amplitude. However, as with other tricyclic antidepressants, maprotiline lowers the convulsive threshold. Maprotiline acts as an antagonist at central presynaptic &alpha;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and hetero-receptors, an action that is postulated to result in an increase in central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. Maprotiline is also a moderate peripheral &alpha;<sub>1</sub> adrenergic antagonist, which may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use. Maprotiline also inhibits the amine transporter, delaying the reuptake of noradrenaline and norepinephrine. Lastly, maprotiline is a strong inhibitor of the histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor, which explains its sedative actions.","Hepatic. Maprotiline is metabolized by <i>N</i>-demethylation, deamination, aliphatic and aromatic hydroxylations and by formation of aromatic methoxy derivatives.

2384.0,3014.0,T3D2972,Melatonin,"Melatonin is a biogenic amine that is found in animals, plants and microbes. Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.",73-31-4,896.0,C13H16N2O2,232.12118,White powder.,117°C,,,The absorption and bioavailability of melatonin varies widely.,"Melatonin is a derivative of tryptophan. It binds to melatonin receptor type 1A, which then acts on adenylate cylcase and the inhibition of a cAMP signal transduction pathway. Melatonin not only inhibits adenylate cyclase, but it also activates phosphilpase C. This potentiates the release of arachidonate. By binding to melatonin receptors 1 and 2, the downstream signallling cascades have various effects in the body. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and melatonin receptor 2 (MT2). Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types.The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated for over two decades or since 1986. It is somewhat known, but still not fully understood. When melatonin receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes.
MT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SNC), hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.
The binding of melatonin to melatonin receptors activates a few signaling pathways. MT1 receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition causes a rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorilation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. MT1 receptors also activate phospholipase C (PLC), affect ion channels and regulate ion flux inside the cell. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP.[4] As well it hinders guanylyl cyclase and therefore the forming of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Binding to MT2 receptors probably affects PLC which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Activation of the receptor can lead to ion flux inside the cell.","Hepatically metabolized to at least 14 identified metabolites (identified in mouse urine): 6-hydroxymelatonin glucuronide, 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate, N-acetylserotonin glucuronide, N-acetylserotonin sulfate, 6-hydroxymelatonin, 2-oxomelatonin, 3-hydroxymelatonin, melatonin glucuronide, cyclic melatonin, cyclic N-acetylserotonin glucuronide, cyclic 6-hydroxymelatonin, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, di-hydroxymelatonin and its glucuronide conjugate. 6-Hydroxymelatonin glucuronide is the major metabolite found in mouse urine (65-88% of total melatonin metabolites in urine). 
Half Life: 35 to 50 minutes","LD50: 3200 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (A308)",,No indication of carcinogenicity to humans (not listed by IARC).,"Used orally for jet lag, insomnia, shift-work disorder, circadian rhythm disorders in the blind (evidence for efficacy), and benzodiazepine and nicotine withdrawal. Evidence indicates that melatonin is likely effective for treating circadian rhythm sleep disorders in blind children and adults. It has received FDA orphan drug status as an oral medication for this use. A number of studies have shown that melatonin may be effective for treating sleep-wake cycle disturbances in children and adolescents with mental retardation, autism, and other central nervous system disorders. It appears to decrease the time to fall asleep in children with developmental disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, autism, and mental retardation. It may also improve secondary insomnia associated with various sleep-wake cycle disturbances. Other possible uses for which there is some evidence for include: benzodiazepine withdrawal, cluster headache, delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), primary insomnia, jet lag, nicotine withdrawal, preoperative anxiety and sedation, prostate cancer, solid tumors (when combined with IL-2 therapy in certain cancers), sunburn prevention (topical use), tardive dyskinesia, thrombocytopenia associated with cancer, chemotherapy and other disorders. ",,"Tolerance can develop, in which the person needs larger doses to achieve the desired effect; this can lead to overdose and death. Accidents or injury can also occur due to the side effects of loss of coordination, slowed reaction time, sleepiness and impaired judgment.

2388.0,3018.0,T3D2976,Diphenhydramine,"Diphenhydramine is a histamine H1 antagonist used as an antiemetic, antitussive, for dermatoses and pruritus, for hypersensitivity reactions, as a hypnotic, an antiparkinson, and as an ingredient in common cold preparations. It has some undesired antimuscarinic and sedative effects. -- Pubchem; Pseudoephedrine is a phenethylamine, and an isomer of ephedrine. Pseudoephedrine is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) of the (1S,2S)- diastereomer of ephedrine (which has 1R,2S- configuration). Other names are (+)-pseudoephedrine and D-pseudoephedrine (Reynolds, 1989). The enantiomer (-)-(1R,2R)-Pseudoephedrine has fewer side-effects, fewer central nervous system (CNS) stimulatory effects, does not reduce to d-methamphetamine, yet retains its efficacy as a decongestant. However, the patent holder for (-)-Pseudoephedrine (Pfizer/Warner-Lambert) has not yet sought or received government approval for its sale to the public.(US Patent 6,495,529); Treatment for urinary incontinence is an unlabeled use for these medications. Unlabeled use means doctors can use the medication to treat a condition other than that for which it was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These medications are approved by the FDA for the treatment of nasal congestion caused by colds or allergies. However it has also been successful in treating stress incontinence by increasing the pressure (tension) exerted by the muscles of the bladder neck and the urethra, which helps retain the urine within the bladder. Despite being one of the oldest antihistamines on the market, it is by and large the most effective antihistamine available, either by prescription or over-the-counter, and has been shown to exceed the effectiveness of even the latest prescription drugs. Consequently, it is frequently used when an allergic reaction requires fast, effective reversal of the (often dangerous) effects of a massive histamine release. However, it is not always the drug of choice for treating allergies. Like many other first generation antihistamines, is also a potent anticholinergic agent. This leads to profound drowsiness as a very common side-effect, along with the possibilities of motor impairment (ataxia), dry mouth and throat, flushed skin, rapid or irregular heartbeat (tachycardia), blurred vision at near point due to lack of accommodation (cycloplegia), abnormal sensitivity to bright light (photophobia), pupil dilatation, urinary retention, constipation, difficulty concentrating, short-term memory loss, visual disturbances, hallucinations, confusion, erectile dysfunction, and delirium. -- Wikipedia;.",58-73-1,3100.0,C17H21NO,255.16231,White powder.,161-162°C,150-165°C at 2.00E+00 mm Hg,3060 mg/L (at 37°C),Oral; topical ; parenteral(intramuscular or intravenous injection).

2476.0,3127.0,T3D3085,Capsaicin,"Capsaicin is identified as the primary pungent principle in Capsicum fruits. Hot chili peppers that belong to the plant genus Capsicum (family Solanaceae) are among the most heavily consumed spices throughout the world. The capsaicin content of green and red peppers ranges from 0.1 to 1%. Capsaicin evokes numerous biological effects and thus has been the target of extensive., investigations since its initial identification in 1919. One of the most recognized physiological properties of capsaicin is its selective effects on the peripheral part of the sensory nervous system, particularly on the primary afferent neurons. The compound is known to deplete the neurotransmitter of painful impulses known as substance P from the sensory nerve terminals, which provides a rationale for its use as a versatile experimental tool for studying pain mechanisms and also for pharmacotherapy to treat some peripheral painful states, such as rheumatoid arthritis, post-herpetic neuralgia, post-mastectomy pain syndrome and diabetic neuropathy. Considering the frequent consumption of capsaicin as a food additive and its current therapeutic application, correct assessment of any harmful effects of this compound is important from the public health standpoint. Ingestion of large amounts of capsaicin has been reported to cause histopathological and biochemical changes, including erosion of gastric mucosa and hepatic necrosis. However, there are contradictory data on the mutagenicity of capsaicin. A recent epidemiological study conducted in Mexico revealed that consumers of chili pepper were at higher risk for gastric cancer than non-consumers. However, it remains unclear whether capsaicin present in hot chili pepper is a major causative factor in the aetiology of gastric cancer in humans. A growing number of recent studies have focused on anticarcinogenic or antimutagenic phytochemicals, particularly those included in human diet. In summary, capsaicin has dual effects on chemically induced carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. Although a minute amount of capsaicin displays few or no deleterious effects, heavy ingestion of the compound has been associated with necrosis, ulceration and even carcinogenesis. Capsaicin is considered to be metabolized by cytochrome P-450-dependent mixed-function oxidases to reactive species. (A7835).",404-86-4,1548943.0,C18H27NO3,305.19909,White powder.,65°C,,,Oral (ingestion) (L1817) ; dermal (L1817),"The burning and painful sensations associated with capsaicin result from its chemical interaction with sensory neurons. Capsaicin, as a member of the vanilloid family, binds to the vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1). VR1 permits cations to pass through the cell membrane and into the cell when activated. The resulting depolarization of the neuron stimulates it to signal the brain. By binding to the VR1 receptor, the capsaicin molecule produces the same sensation that excessive heat or abrasive damage would cause, explaining why the spiciness of capsaicin is described as a burning sensation.

It is a powerful irritant that is commonly used in food products to give them added spice. Capsaicin is also used in topical ointments to relieve the pain of peripheral neuropathy and can be found in pepper spray. (L1246),,Capsaicin is a powerful irritant and severe over-exposure can result in death. (L1246),"Capsaicin is a powerful irritant and causes burning or stinging pain to the skin. Ingestion of large amounts can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and burning diarrhea. Eye exposure produces intense tearing, pain, conjunctivitis and blepharospasm. (L1246)","Capsaicin should be washed off the skin using soap, shampoo, or other detergents, or rubbed off with oily compounds such as vegetable oil, paraffin oil, petroleum jelly, creams, or polyethylene glycol. Burning and pain symptoms can be effectively relieved by cooling from ice, cold water, cold surfaces, or a flow of air. In severe cases, eye burn might be treated symptomatically with topical ophthalmic anaesthetics, while mucous membrane burn can be treated with lidocaine gel. Capsaicin-induced asthma might be treated with nebulized bronchodilators or oral antihistamines or corticosteroids.

2511.0,3258.0,T3D3216,Ethyl acrylate,"Ethyl acrylate is found in pineapple. Ethyl acrylate is a flavouring ingredient Although there are some reports claiming that ethyl acrylate is a carcinogen, major respected bodies regard the evidence of human carcinogenicity as weak and/or inconsistent. The International Agency for Research on Cancer stated, Overall evaluation, Ethyl acrylate is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states, Human studies on occupational exposure to ethyl acrylate&hellip; have suggested a relationship between exposure to the chemical(s) and colorectal cancer, but the evidence is conflicting and inconclusive. In a study by the National Toxicology Program (NTP), increased incidences of squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas of the forestomach were observed in rats and mice exposed via gavage (experimentally placing the chemical in the stomach).

Carrier of aroma of butter, vinegar, coffee, and other foods. Beer sometimes undergoes a diacetyl rest, which entails waiting two or three days after fermentation is complete, to allow the yeast to absorb the diacetyl it produced earlier in the fermentation cycle.

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Diacetyl  is reduced to 2,3-butanediol (A350).","LD50: 1580 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L1280)

(L135),"Carrier of aroma of butter, vinegar, coffee and other foods (A646).",,"Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Causes eye irritation, redness and pain. Causes moderate skin irritation. Harmful if swallowed.

For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

Rapid infusion may also cause flushing of the upper body (""red neck"") or pain and muscle spasm of the chest and back. These reactions usually resolve within 20 minutes but may persist for several hours. Such events are infrequent if vancomycin is given by a slow infusion over 60 minutes.

2637.0,3646.0,T3D3596,Iodine,"Iodine is an essential trace element. Chemically, iodine is the least reactive of the halogens, and the most electropositive halogen after astatine. However, iodine does not occur in the free state in nature. As with all other halogens , when freed from its compounds iodine forms diatomic molecules (I2). Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in medicine, photography, and dyes. Iodine is required for the production of thyroid hormones, which are essential for normal brain development, and the fetus, newborn, and young child are particularly vulnerable to iodine deficiency. Physiologically, iodine exists as an ion in the body. The iodine requirement increases during pregnancy and recommended intakes are in the range of 220-250 microg/day. Monitoring iodine status during pregnancy is a challenge. New recommendations from World Health Organization suggest that a median urinary iodine concentration >250 microg/L and <500 microg/L indicates adequate iodine intake in pregnancy. Based on this range, it appears that many pregnant women in have inadequate intakes. Thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration in the newborn is a sensitive indicator of mild iodine deficiency in late pregnancy. The potential adverse effects of mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy are uncertain. Controlled trials of iodine supplementation in mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women suggest beneficial effects on maternal and newborn serum thyroglobulin and thyroid volume, but no effects on maternal and newborn total or free thyroid hormone concentrations. There are no long-term data on the effect of iodine supplementation on birth outcomes or infant development. New data from well-controlled studies indicate that iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient school-age children has clear benefits: it improves cognitive and motor function; it also increases concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3, and improves somatic growth.

This results in decreased iodination of thyroglobulin and inhibited production and release of T4 and T3, causing hypothyroidism. (L1844)","Iodine can enter the body following ingestion, inhalation, or dermal exposure. In the body, iodine and iodide accumulates in the thyroid gland, where it is used for producing the thyroid hormones T4 and T3. Iodide in the thyroid gland is incorporated into a protein, thyroglobulin, as covalent complexes with tyrosine residues. The iodination of thyroglobulin is catalyzed by the enzyme thyroid peroxidase. The iodination reactions occur at the follicular cell-lumen interface and consist of the oxidation of iodide to form a reactive intermediate, the formation of monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine residues in thyroglobulin, and the coupling of theiodinated tyrosine residues to form T4 (coupling of two diiodotyrosine residues) or T3 (coupling of a monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine residue) in thyroglobulin. The major pathways of metabolism of iodine that occur outside of the thyroid gland involve the catabolism of T4 and T3, and include deiodination reactions, ether bond cleavage of thyronine, oxidative deamination and decarboxylation of the side chain of thyronine, and conjugation of the phenolic hydroxyl group on thyronine with glucuronic acid and sulfate.

2641.0,3653.0,T3D3600,4-Aminophenol,"4-Aminophenol is an amphoteric molecule and a reducing agent. Aminophenols are intermediates in the synthesis of dyes and can thus be found in numerous cosmetics products, particularly hair dyes. 4-aminophenol is considered a minor nephrotoxic metabolite of phenacetin and acetaminophen (paracetamol) in man. 4-Aminophenol can undergo autoxidations and metal-catalyzed and enzymatic oxidations in man to produce reactive oxygen species. (A7848) (L1882)",123-30-8,403.0,C6H7NO,,White powder. (L1883),187.5°C,187.5°C,16 mg/mL at 20°C,Oral (L138) ; inhalation (L138),"4-Aminobiphenyl requires metabolic activation in order to exert its toxicity. This is catalyzed by N-hydroxylation via cytochrome P450 1A2, then followed by O-sulfation and O-acetylation by sulfotransferase 1A1 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2. The metabolites of 4-aminobiphenyl then form adducts with DNA, inducing mutations. 4-Aminobiphenyl and its metabolites may also cross the placenta and have fetal effects. (1, 2, 3, 4).  It is also though that the mode of action involves metabolic activation by N-hydroxylation, followed by N-esterification leading to the formation of a reactive electrophile, which binds covalently to DNA, principally to deoxyguanosine, leading to an increased rate of DNA mutations and ultimately to the development of cancer. In humans and dogs, the urinary bladder urothelium is the target organ, whereas in mice it is the bladder and liver; in other species, other tissues can be involved. Differences in organ specificity are thought to be due to differences in metabolic activation versus inactivation (A15085).",,"LD50: 375 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T14)",,Not listed by IARC.,"4-Aminophenol is commonly used as a developer in black and white film, marketed under the name Rodinal.

(L1882, L1883)",,"4-Aminophenol may act as a skin sensitizer and cause contact dermatitis. In addition, inhalation of large amounts can cause methemoglobinemia and bronchial asthma. (T21)","4-Aminophenol may cause contact dermatitis. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may include shortness of breath, cyanosis, mental status changes, headache, fatigue, exercise intolerance, dizziness and loss of consciousness. Severe methemoglobinemia can result in dysrhythmias, seizures, coma, and death. (T21, L1613)",Methemoglobinemia can be treated with supplemental oxygen and methylene blue 1% solution administered intravenously slowly over five minutes followed by IV flush with normal saline. Methylene blue restores the iron in hemoglobin to its normal (reduced) oxygen-carrying state.

This colourless, odourless, and hygroscopic crystalline solid is highly soluble in water. Due to its excellent capability to penetrate skin, glycolic acid is often used in skin care products, most often as a chemical peel. It may reduce wrinkles, acne scarring, and hyperpigmentation and improve many other skin conditions, including actinic keratosis, hyperkeratosis, and seborrheic keratosis. Once applied, glycolic acid reacts with the upper layer of the epidermis, weakening the binding properties of the lipids that hold the dead skin cells together. This allows the outer skin to dissolve, revealing the underlying skin. It is thought that this is due to the reduction of calcium ion concentrations in the epidermis and the removal of calcium ions from cell adhesions, leading to desquamation. Glycolic acid is a known inhibitor of tyrosinase. This can suppress melanin formation and lead to a lightening of skin colour. Acute doses of glycolic acid on skin or eyes leads to local effects that are typical of a strong acid (e.g. dermal and eye irritation). Glycolate is a nephrotoxin if consumed orally. A nephrotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the kidney and kidney tissues. Glycolic acid's renal toxicity is due to its metabolism to oxalic acid. Glycolic and oxalic acid, along with excess lactic acid, are responsible for the anion gap metabolic acidosis. Oxalic acid readily precipitates with calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. Renal tissue injury is caused by widespread deposition of oxalate crystals and the toxic effects of glycolic acid. Glycolic acid does exhibit some inhalation toxicity and can cause respiratory, thymus, and liver damage if present in very high levels over long periods of time.",79-14-1,757.0,C2H4O3,,White powder.,75-80°C,,1000 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L1909) ; dermal (L1909),"Glycolic acid's toxicity is due to its metabolism to oxalic acid.

Oxalic acid readily precipitates with calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. Tissue injury is caused by widespread deposition of oxalate crystals and the toxic effects of glycolic acid. (A612, A613) ","The main path of the degradation of glycolic acid is to glyoxylic acid. This reaction is mediated by lactic dehydrogenase or glycolic acid oxidase. Once glyoxylic acid is formed, it is apparently degraded very rapidly to a variety of products, a few of which have been observed. Its breakdown to 2-hydroxy-3-oxoadipate it is thought, is mediated by thiamine pyrophosphate in the presence of magnesium ions. The formation of glycine involves pyridoxal phosphate and glyoxylate transaminase, whereas the formation of carbon dioxide and water via formic acid apparently involves coenzyme A (CoA) and flavin mononucleotides.

It may reduce wrinkles, acne scarring, hyperpigmentation and improve many other skin conditions, including actinic keratosis, hyperkeratosis, and seborrheic keratosis. Glycolic acid is also a useful intermediate for organic synthesis and finds employment in the textile industry as a dyeing and tanning agent, in food processing as a flavoring agent and as a preservative. Glycolic acid is often included into emulsion polymers, solvents and additives for ink and paint in order to improve flow properties and impart gloss. (L1909)",,"Glycolic acid metabolizes to oxalic acid, which reacts with calcium and forms calcium oxalate crystals in the kidney. This can cause kidney injury, leading to acute kidney failure. (L1023)
Chronically high levels of glycolic acid are associated with the inborn error of metabolism known as Type I primary hyperoxaluria. Oxalate stones in primary hyperoxaluria tend to be severe, resulting in relatively early kidney damage (before age 20), which impairs the excretion of oxalate leading to a further acceleration in accumulation of oxalate in the body. After the development of renal failure patients may develop oxalate deposits in the bones, joints and bone marrow. Severe cases may develop haematological problems such as anaemia and thrombocytopaenia. The deposition of oxalate in the body is sometimes called ""oxalosis"" to be distinguished from ""oxaluria"" which refers to oxalate in the urine.","Glycolic acid is a strong irritant. Accumulation of glycolic acid and its metabolite, oxalic acid, causes tachycardia, hypertension, hyperventilation, and metabolic acidosis. (L1023, L1909)","Chronic Exposure: In some patients with primary hyperoxaluria type 1, pyridoxine treatment (vitamin B6) may decrease oxalate excretion and prevent kidney stone formation.

It is commonly found in rotting apples, and the amount of patulin in apple products is generally viewed as a measure of the quality of the apples used in production. It is not a particularly potent toxin, but a number of studies have shown that it is genotoxic, which has led to some theories that it may be a carcinogen, though animal studies have remained inconclusive. Patulin is also an antibiotic. Several countries have instituted patulin restrictions in apple products.

Deoxynivalenol is produced by Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium roseum, responsible for headblight in cereals Vomitoxin, also known as deoxynivalenol (DON), is a type B trichothecene, an epoxy-sesquiterpeneoid. This mycotoxin occurs predominantly in grains such as wheat, barley, oats, rye, and maize, and less often in rice, sorghum, and triticale. The occurrence of deoxynivalenol is associated primarily with Fusarium graminearum (Gibberella zeae) and F. culmorum, both of which are important plant pathogens which cause Fusarium head blight in wheat and Gibberella ear rot in maize. Deoxynivalenol is a direct relationship between the incidence of Fusarium head blight and contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol has been established. The incidence of Fusarium head blight is strongly associated with moisture at the time of flowering (anthesis), and the timing of rainfall, rather than the amount, is the most critical factor. Furthermore, deoxynivalenol contents are significantly affected by the susceptibility of cultivars towards Fusarium species, previous crop, tillage practices, and fungicide useDeoxynivalenol belongs to the family of Trichothecenes. These are sesquiterpene mycotoxins structurally characterized by the presence of an epoxide ring and a benzoyran derivative with a variant number of hydroxyl, acetly, or other substituents [1].

(A3101)","Unlike many other mycotoxins, trichothecenes do not require metabolic activation to exert their biological activity, instead directly reacting with cellular components. Trichothecenes are cytotoxic to most eukaryotic cells due to their powerful ability to inhibit protein synthesis. They do this by freely moving across the plasma membrane and binding specifically to ribosomes with high-affinity. Specifically, they interfere with the active site of peptidyl transferase at the 3'-end of large 28S ribosomal RNA and inhibit the initiation, elongation or termination step of protein synthesis, as well as cause polyribosomal disaggregation. Protein synthesis is an essential function in all tissues, but tissues where cells are actively and rapidly growing and dividing are very susceptible to the toxins. Additionally, binding to ribosomes is thought to activate proteins in downstream signalling events related to immune response and apoptosis, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases. This is known as ribotoxic stress response. Trichothecenes may also induce some alterations in membrane structure, leading to increased lipid peroxidation and inhibition of electron transport activity in the mitochondria. They can further induce apoptosis through generation of reactive oxygen species. Further secondary effects of trichothecenes include inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis, and also inhibition of mitosis. (L1948, L1949, A2962, A2963, A2964, A2980) ","Trichothecenes are lipophilic and thus easily absorbed through the skin, gut, and pulmonary mucosa. They are metabolized mainly by cytochrome P-450 and trichothecene-specific carboxylesterase activity in the liver, although other tissues such as the kidney, spleen, and intestine also show some metabolic activity. Trichothecenes are metabolically transformed to less toxic metabolites by such reactions as hydrolysis, hydroxylation, de-epoxidation, and glucuronidation. Deoxynivalenol is metabolized mainly to the de-epoxy metabolite. Metabolites are excreted in the urine and feces. (L1910, L1949, A738)","LD50: 70 mg/kg  (Intraperitoneal, Mouse) (T312)

TGMP interferes with the synthesis of guanine nucleotides by its inhibition of purine biosynthesis by pseudofeedback inhibition of glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, the first enzyme unique to the de novo pathway of purine ribonucleotide synthesis. TGMP also inhibits the conversion of inosinic acid (IMP) to xanthylic acid (XMP) by competition for the enzyme IMP dehydrogenase. Thioguanine nucleotides are incorporated into both the DNA and the RNA by phosphodiester linkages, and some studies have shown that incorporation of such false bases contributes to the cytotoxicity of thioguanine. Its tumor inhibitory properties may be due to one or more of its effects on feedback inhibition of de novo purine synthesis; inhibition of purine nucleotide interconversions; or incorporation into the DNA and RNA.

These fatty acids were also shown to induce oxidative stress in the brain (A15456). Experiments suggest that OA and DA impair brain mitochondrial energy homeostasis that could underlie at least in part the neuropathology of MCADD. (A15457)","Capric acid (decanoic acid) is rapidly metabolized by the β-oxidative pathway, giving rise to C8- and C6-dicarboxylic acids (T29). The enzyme MCAD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) is responsible for the dehydrogenation step of fatty acids with chain lengths between 6 and 12 carbons as they undergo beta-oxidation in the mitochondria. Fatty acid beta-oxidation provides energy after the body has used up its stores of glucose and glycogen. This typically occurs during periods of extended fasting or illness when caloric intake is reduced, and energy needs are increased. Beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids produces two carbon units, acetyl-CoA and the reducing equivalents NADH and FADH2. NADH and FADH2 enter the electron transport chain and are used to make ATP. Acetyl-CoA enters the Krebs Cycle and is also used to make ATP via the electron transport chain and substrate level phosphorylation. When the supply of acetyl-CoA (coming from the beta-oxidation of fatty acids) exceeds the capacity of the Krebs Cycle to metabolize acetyl-CoA, the excess acetyl-CoA molecules are converted to ketone bodies (acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate) by HMG-CoA synthase in the liver. Ketone bodies can also be used for energy especially by the brain and heart; in fact they become the main sources of energy for those two organs after day three of starvation.

(L135),"Capric acid occurs naturally in coconut oil (about 10%) and palm kernel oil (about 4%), otherwise it is uncommon in typical seed oils. It is found in the milk of various mammals and to a lesser extent in other animal fats. Capric acid is used in the manufacturing of esters for artificial fruit flavors and perfumes. It is also use as an intermediate in chemical syntheses. It is used in organic synthesis and industrially in the manufacture of perfumes, lubricants, greases, rubber, dyes, plastics, food additives and pharmaceuticals. (Wikipedia)",,"Octanoic (OA) and decanoic (DA) acids are the predominant metabolites accumulating in medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD; E.C. 1.3.99.3) deficiency (MCADD), the most common inherited defect of fatty acid oxidation. Glycine and l-carnitine bind to these fatty acids giving rise to derivatives that also accumulate in this disorder. The clinical presentation typically occurs in early childhood but can occasionally be delayed until adulthood. The major features of the disease include hypoglycemia, vomiting, lethargy and encephalopathy after fasting, infection or other metabolic stressors. (A15457)","MCADD presents in early childhood with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and liver dysfunction, often preceded by extended periods of fasting or an infection with vomiting. Infants who are exclusively breast-fed may present in this manner shortly after birth, due to poor feeding. In some individuals the first manifestation of MCADD may be sudden death following a minor illness. A number of individuals with MCADD may remain completely asymptomatic, provided they never encounter a situation that sufficiently stresses their metabolism. (Wikipedia) Irritating to the skin, lung, or gastrointestinal tract, depending on the route of exposure (MSDS).","Management of acute MCADD includes rapid correction of hypoglycemia, rehydration and treatment of the underlying infection or other stress factor.

It does so by activating Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR‘±) 'transcription factor ligand', a receptor that is involved in metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, as well as adipose tissue differentiation. This increase in the synthesis of lipoprotein lipase thereby increases the clearance of triglycerides. Chylomicrons are degraded, VLDLs are converted to LDLs, and LDLs are converted to HDL. This is accompanied by a slight increase in secretion of lipids into the bile and ultimately the intestine.

Their use in over-the-counter sedatives and headache remedies (such as Bromo-Seltzer) in the United States extended to 1975, when bromides were withdrawn as ingredients, due to chronic toxicity.

3673.0,5059.0,T3D5000,Sulfuric acid,"Sulfuric acid is a highly corrosive strong mineral acid with the molecular formula H2SO4. It is a pungent-ethereal, colorless to slightly yellow viscous liquid which is soluble in water at all concentrations. Sometimes, it is dyed dark brown during production to alert people to its hazards. The historical name of this acid is oil of vitriol.
Concentrated sulfuric acid is 98% pure and shows different properties depending upon its concentration. For instance battery acid is 30% sulfuric acid. Because the hydration reaction of sulfuric acid is highly exothermic, dilution should always be performed by adding the acid to the water rather than the water to the acid. Pure sulfuric acid is not encountered naturally on Earth in its anhydrous form, due to its great affinity for water. Dilute sulfuric acid is a constituent of acid rain, which is formed by atmospheric oxidation of sulfur dioxide in the presence of water – i.e., oxidation of sulfurous acid. Sulfur dioxide is the main byproduct produced when sulfur-containing fuels such as coal or oil are burned. Most sulfuric acid (~60%) is consumed for fertilizers, particularly superphosphates, ammonium phosphate and ammonium sulfates. About 20% is used in chemical industry for production of detergents, synthetic resins, dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, petroleum catalysts, insecticides and antifreeze, as well as in various processes such as oil well acidicizing, aluminium reduction, paper sizing, water treatment.",7664-93-9,1118.0,H2O4S,,"Clear, colorless, odorless liquid. Sometimes, it is dyed dark brown during production to alert people to its hazards.",10 °C,337 °C,Miscible,Inhalation; Ingestion; Dermal; Eyes,"Many strong acids cause tissue burns through the denaturation of proteins and partial hydrolysis of proteins.  Most proteins denature at pH values of less than 3-4.  The large-scale denaturation of proteins, de-esterification of lipids and subsequent desiccation of tissues leads to chemical burns.  Symptoms include itching, bleaching or darkening of skin or tissues, blistering and burning sensations. More specifically, sulfuric acid readily decomposes proteins and lipids through amide hydrolysis and ester hydrolysis upon contact with living tissues. In addition, it exhibits a strong dehydrating property on carbohydrates, liberating extra heat and causing secondary thermal burns. The strong oxidizing property may also extend its corrosiveness on the tissue. Because of such reasons, damage posed by sulfuric acid is potentially more severe than that caused by other comparable strong acids, such as hydrochloric acid and nitric acid.",,"LD50: 2140 mg/kg (Oral, rat); LC50: 25 mg/m3 (Inhalation, rat)",,Occupational exposures to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). (L135),"Sulfuric acid is found naturally in acid rain or rainwater near industrial sites. Most sulfuric acid (~60%) is consumed for fertilizers, particularly superphosphates, ammonium phosphate and ammonium sulfates. About 20% is used in chemical industry for production of detergents, synthetic resins, dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, petroleum catalysts, insecticides and antifreeze, as well as in various processes such as oil well acidicizing, aluminium reduction, paper sizing, water treatment.",The limit of exposure of sulfuric acid is fixed at 1 mg/m3.,"Sulfuric acid at a high concentration can cause very serious damage upon contact, as it not only causes chemical burns via hydrolysis, but also secondary thermal burns via dehydration. It burns the cornea and can lead to permanent blindness if splashed onto eyes. Accordingly, it rapidly attacks the cornea and can induce permanent blindness if splashed onto eyes. If ingested, it damages internal organs irreversibly and may even be fatal. Inhalation of sulfuric acid spray mist may produce severe irritation of respiratory tract, characterized by coughing, choking, or shortness of breath.  Sulfuric acid is also a known carcinogen. Sulfuric acid may be toxic to kidneys, lungs, heart, cardiovascular system, upper respiratory tract, eyes and teeth.","Skin contact can cause redness, pain, blisters and severe skin burns. Sulfuric acid may cause severe burns to the eye and permanent eye damage. Severe and rapid corrosive burns of the mouth, gullet and gastrointestinal tract will result if sulfuric acid is swallowed. Symptoms include burning, choking, nausea, vomiting and severe pain.","The mainstay of treatment of any acid burn is copious irrigation with large amounts of tap water. To be most effective, treatment should be started immediately after exposure, preferably before arrival in the emergency department. Remove any contaminated clothing. Do not attempt to neutralize the burn with weak reciprocal chemicals (i.e. alkali for acid burns), because the heat generated from the chemical reaction may cause severe thermal injury.",2014-10-15 22:10:18+00:00,2014-12-24 20:27:02+00:00,Sulfuric acid,,C00059,,26836.0,,,,,,,True,OS(O)(=O)=O,H2O4S,"InChI=1S/H2O4S/c1-5(2,3)4/h(H2,1,2,3,4)",InChIKey=QAOWNCQODCNURD-UHFFFAOYSA-N,98.078,97.967379242,Exogenous,1,,HMDB32444,CHEMBL572964,1086.0,,,,"Sulfurate
