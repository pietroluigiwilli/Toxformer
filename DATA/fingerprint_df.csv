0,0,0,2,T3D0001,Arsenic,"Arsenic(As) is a ubiquitous metalloid found in several forms in food and the environment, such as the soil, air and water. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. The predominant form is inorganic arsenic in drinking water, which is both highly toxic and carcinogenic and rapidly bioavailable. Arsenic is currently one of the most important environmental global contaminants and toxicants, particularly in the developing countries. For decades, very large populations have been and are currently still exposed to inorganic Arsenic through geogenically contaminated drinking water. An increased incidence of disease mediated by this toxicant is the consequence of long-term exposure. In human's chronic ingestion of inorganic arsenic (> 500 mg/L As) has been associated with cardiovascular, nervous, hepatic and renal diseases and diabetes mellitus as well as cancer of the skin, bladder, lung, liver and prostate. Contrary to the earlier view that methylated compounds are innocuous, the methylated metabolites are now recognized to be both toxic and carcinogenic, possibly due to genotoxicity, inhibition of antioxidative enzyme functions, or other mechanisms. Arsenic inhibits indirectly sulfhydryl containing enzymes and interferes with cellular metabolism. Effects involve such phenomena as cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and inhibition of enzymes with antioxidant function. These are all related to nutritional factors directly or indirectly. Nutritional studies both in experimental and epidemiological studies provide convincing evidence that nutritional intervention, including chemoprevention, offers a pragmatic approach to mitigate the health effects of arsenic exposure, particularly cancer, in the relatively resource-poor developing countries. Nutritional intervention, especially with micronutrients, many of which are antioxidants and share the same pathway with Arsenic , appears a host defence against the health effects of arsenic contamination in developing countries and should be embraced as it is pragmatic and inexpensive.

At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and by competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Arsenic's carcinogenicity is influenced by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. The binding of other arsenic protein targets may also cause altered DNA repair enzyme activity, altered DNA methylation patterns and cell proliferation. (T1, A17)","Arsenic is absorbed mainly by inhalation or ingestion, as to a lesser extent, dermal exposure. It is then distributed throughout the body, where it is reduced into arsenite if necessary, then methylated into monomethylarsenic (MMA) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) by arsenite methyltransferase. Arsenic and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Arsenic is known to induce the metal-binding protein metallothionein, which decreases the toxic effects of arsenic and other metals by binding them and making them biologically inactive, as well as acting as an antioxidant.

The World Health Organization asserts that a level of 0.01 mg/L in drinking water poses a risk of 1/1600 chance of lifetime skin cancer risk.","Arsenic poisoning can lead to death from multi-system organ failure, probably from necrotic cell death, not apoptosis. Arsenic is also a known carcinogen, especially in skin, liver, bladder and lung cancers. (T1, L20) Arsenic poisoning is has also been associated with heart disease, (hypertension related cardiovascular), stroke (cerebrovascular diseases), chronic lower respiratory diseases and diabetes. Chronic exposure to arsenic can lead to a vitamin A deficiency which is related to heart disease and night blindness.","Exposure to lower levels of arsenic can cause nausea and vomiting, decreased production of red and white blood cells, abnormal heart rhythm, damage to blood vessels, and a sensation of “pins and needles” in hands and feet. Breathing high levels of inorganic arsenic can give you a sore throat or irritated lungs. Arsenic also affects the brain, causing neurological disturbances such as headaches, confusion, and drowsiness. (A1)","Arsenic poisoning can be treated by chelation therapy, using chelating agents such as dimercaprol, EDTA or DMSA. Charcoal tablets may also be used for less severe cases. In addition, maintaining a diet high in sulfur helps eliminate arsenic from the body.

3,3,5,8,T3D0007,Cadmium,"Cadmium (group IIB of the periodic table of elements) is a heavy metal. It is not a naturally occurring metal in biological systems. Cadmium poses severe risks to human health. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Up to this day, it has not been shown that cadmium has any physiological function within the human body. Interest has therefore risen in its biohazardous potential. As first described by Friedrich Stromeyer (Gottingen, Germany) in 1817, cadmium intoxication can lead to kidney, bone, and pulmonary damage. Cadmium is widely used in industrial processes, e.g as an anticorrosive agent, as a stabilizer in PVC products, as a colour pigment, a neutron absorber in nuclear power plants, and in the fabrication of nickel cadmium batteries. Phosphate fertilizers also show a big cadmium load. Although some cadmium containing products can be recycled, a large share of the general cadmium pollution is caused by dumping and incinerating cadmium polluted waste. In Scandinavia for example, cadmium concentration in agricultural soil increases by 0.2 percent per year. Total global emission of cadmium amounts to 7000 t/year. The maximum permissible value for workers according to German law is 15 ug/l. For comparison: Non-smokers show an average cadmium blood concentration of 0.5 ug/l. Basically there are three possible ways of cadmium resorption: Gastrointestinal, pulmonary and dermal. The uptake through the human gastrointestinal is approximately 5 percent of an ingested amount of cadmium, depending on the exact dose and nutritional composition. The major source of inhalative cadmium intoxication is cigarette smoke. The human lung resorbes 40 to 60 percent of the cadmium in tobacco smoke. Little research has been done on dermal absorption of cadmium. Two mechanisms facilitate cadmium absorption by the skin: binding of a free cadmium ion to sulfhydryl radicals of cysteine in epidermal keratins, or an induction and complexing with metallothionein. Once taken up by the blood, the majority of cadmium is transported bound to proteins, such as Albumin and Metallothionein. The first organ reached after cadmium uptake into the GI-blood is the liver. Here cadmium induces the production of Metallothionein. After consecutive hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, Cd-Metallothionein complexes are washed into sinusoidal blood. From here, parts of the absorbed cadmium enter the entero-hepatical cycle via secretion into the biliary tract in form of Cadmium-glutathione conjugates. Enzymatically degraded to cadmium-cysteine complexes in the biliary tree, cadmium reenters the small intestines. The main organ for long-term cadmium accumulation is the kidney. Here the half life period for cadmium is approximately 10 years. A life long intake can therefore lead to a cadmium accumulation in the kidney, consequently resulting in tubulus cell necrosis. The blood concentration of cadmium serves as a reliable indicator for a recent exposition, while the urinary concentration reflects past exposure, body burden and renal accumulation. Excretion of Cadmium takes place via faeces and urine. (A7670).",7440-43-9,31193.0,Cd,113.903358,Bluish-white metallic solid.,321°C,"1040 K

Toxic effects are observed once the concentration of cadmium exceeds that of available metallothionein, and it has also been shown that the cadmium-metallothionein complex may be damaging. Accumulation of cadmium in the kidney results in increased excretion of vital low and high molecular weight proteins. Cadmium is a high affinity zinc analog and can interfere in its biological processes. It also binds to and activates the estrogen receptor, likely stimulating the growth of certain types of cancer cells and causing other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. Cadmium causes cell apoptosis by activating mitogen-activated protein kinases. (L8, A18, A19, A28)","Cadmium is absorbed from oral, inhalation, and dermal routes. Cadmium initially binds to metallothionein and albumin and is transported mainly to the kidney and liver. Toxic effects are observed once the concentration of cadmium exceeds that of available metallothionein, and it has also been shown that the cadmium-metallothionein complex may be damaging. Cadmium is not known to undergo any direct metabolic conversion and is excreted unchanged, mainly in the urine. (L6)","LD50: 225 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T14)

DDT reduces potassium transport across the membrane. DDT inhibits the inactivation of voltaged-gated sodium channels. The channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization and resulting in a state of hyperexcitability. DDT inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. DDT also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron. DDT is also believed to adversely affect the reproductive system by mimicking endogenous hormones and binding to the estrogen and adrogen receptors. (T10, L85)","DDT is absorbed in the stomach and intestine, after which it enters the lymphatic system and is carried throughout the body and incorporated into fatty tissues. Metabolism of DDT occurs mainly via cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver and kidney, where it undergoes reductive dechlorination to DDD (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane) and DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene). These compounds are further degraded into additional metabolites, mainly DDA (bis(p-chlorophenyl) acetic acid), which are excreted in the urine. (L85)","LD50: 87 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L141)

7,9,14,18,T3D0017,Dieldrin,"Dieldrin is a chlorinated hydrocarbon used as an insecticide, either by itself or as a component of the closely related insectide aldrin. As dieldrin is neurotoxin and tends to bioaccumulate, its use is now banned in most parts of the world. (L86) Dieldrin is a chlorinated hydrocarbon originally produced in 1948 by J. Hyman & Co, Denver, as an insecticide. Dieldrin is closely related to aldrin, which reacts further to form dieldrin. Aldrin is not toxic to insects; it is oxidized in the insect to form dieldrin which is the active compound. Both dieldrin and aldrin are named after the Diels-Alder reaction which is used to form aldrin from a mixture of norbornadiene and hexachlorocyclopentadiene.",60-57-1,969491.0,C12H8Cl6O,377.87063,White powder.,175.5°C,,"0.000195 mg/mL at 25 °C [BIGGAR,JW & RIGGS,RI (1974)]",Oral (L87)  ; inhalation (L87) ; dermal (L87),"Dieldrin antagonizes the action of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acting at the GABA-A receptors, effectively blocking the GABA-induced uptake of chloride ions. Dieldrin also inhibits Na+ K+ ATPase and Ca2+ and Mg2+ ATPase which are essential for the transport of calcium across membranes. This results in the accumulation of intracellular free calcium ions, which promotes release of neurotransmitters from storage vesicles, the subsequent depolarization of adjacent neurons, and the propagation of stimuli throughout the CNS. This results in hyperexcitation and generalized seizures. Dieldrin also binds to alpha-synuclein, leading to the formation of intracellular fibrils. (T10, L87)","Dieldrin is absorbed throught the gastrointestinal tract, lungs and skin. Following absorption, dieldrin is redistributed primarily to fat via the lymphatic system. Dieldrin is metabolized by liver microsomal monooxygenases and epoxide hydratases. Its metabolites, of which the primary one is 9-hydroxydieldrin, are excreted in the faeces.

It also affects transcription by antagonizing estrogen-related receptors. Chlordane induces hepatic cytochrome P-450, causing a large increase in the volume of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which results in hepatocellular enlargement and hypertrophy. Chlordane has also been shown to bind and activate retinoic acid receptor, causing various developmental defects, and inhibit alkaline phosphatases in hepatic and renal tissues.

Chlordane is metabolized mainly in the liver and kidney. Metabolism is slow, and is believed to occur by multiple pathways involving cytochrome P-450 enzymes, glutathione-S-transferase type enzymes, and microsomal mixed-function oxidase systems. The metabolites are generally less toxic and include chlordene chlorohydrin, monohydroxylated dihydrochlordene, and oxychlordane. They are excreted in the urine and faeces.

DDD reduces potassium transport across the membrane. DDD inhibits the inactivation of voltaged-gated sodium channels. The channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization and resulting in a state of hyperexcitability. DDD inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. DDD also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron. DDD is also believed to adversely affect the reproductive system by mimicking endogenous hormones and binding to the estrogen and adrogen receptors. (T10, L85)","DDD is absorbed in the stomach and intestine, after which it enters the lymphatic system and is carried throughout the body and incorporated into fatty tissues.

12,14,22,27,T3D0026,Benzidine,"Benzidine is the organic compound with the formula (C6H4NH2)2. it is an aromatic amine. It is prepared in a two step process from nitrobenzene. First, the nitrobenzene is converted to 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, usually using iron powder as the reducing agent. Treatment of this hydrazine with mineral acids induces a rearrangement reaction to 4,4'-benzidine. Smaller amounts of other isomers are also formed. The benzidine rearrangement, which proceeds intramolecularly, is a classic mechanistic puzzle in organic chemistry.

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are transported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin. Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The major metabolites are hydroxylated products which are excreted in the bile and faeces. The slow metabolism of PCBs means they tend to accumulate in body tissues.

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Toxaphene is absorbed through the intestines and lungs, then distributed mainly to fat tissues.

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Symptoms of low dose exposure include excessive salivation and eye-watering.  Acute dose symptoms include severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Hypertension, hypoglycemia, anxiety, headache, tremor and ataxia may also result.","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-03-06 18:57:57+00:00,2014-12-24 20:20:55+00:00,,,C15470,,,,D014112,Toxaphene,,,1399.0,True,ClCC1(CCl)C(=C)C2(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl,C10H8Cl8,"InChI=1S/C10H8Cl8/c1-4-7(2-11,3-12)9(16)6(14)5(13)8(4,15)10(9,17)18/h5-6H,1-3H2",InChIKey=OEJNXTAZZBRGDN-UHFFFAOYSA-N,411.795,407.813421912,Exogenous,Solid,,,CHEMBL1566504,4447533.0,,,,"Camphechlor

It is a colorless liquid widely used for dry cleaning of fabrics, hence it is sometimes called 'dry-cleaning fluid.' It has a sweet odor detectable by most people at a concentration of 1 part per million (1 ppm). Worldwide production was about one million metric tons in 1985. Animal studies and a study of 99 twins by Dr. Samuel Goldman and researchers at the Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale, California determined there is a 'lot of circumstantial evidence' that exposure to tetrachloroethene increases the risk of developing Parkinson's disease ninefold. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified tetrachloroethene as a Group 2A carcinogen, which means that it is probably carcinogenic to humans. Like many chlorinated hydrocarbons, tetrachloroethene is a central nervous system depressant and can enter the body through respiratory or dermal exposure. Tetrachloroethene dissolves fats from the skin, potentially resulting in skin irritation.

18,20,31,38,T3D0037,Acrolein,"Acrolein (systematic name: propenal) is the simplest unsaturated aldehyde. It is a colourless liquid with a piercing, disagreeable, acrid smell. The smell of burnt fat (as when cooking oil is heated to its smoke point) is caused by glycerol in the burning fat breaking down into acrolein. It is produced industrially from propylene and mainly used as a biocide and a building block to other chemical compounds, such as the amino acid methionine. Acrolein is used as an etherification agent in the preparation of modified food starches. Acrolein is an herbicide and algicide used in water treatment. It is produced by microorganisms, e.g. Clostridium perfringens. Acrolein is a relatively electrophilic compound and a reactive one, hence its high toxicity. It is a good Michael acceptor, hence its useful reaction with thiols. It forms acetals readily, a prominent one being the spirocycle derived from pentaerythritol, diallylidene pentaerythritol. Acrolein participates in many Diels-Alder reactions, even with itself. Via Diels-Alder reactions, it is a precursor to some commercial fragrances, including lyral, norbornene-2-carboxaldehyde, and myrac aldehyde. Acrolein is toxic and is a strong irritant for the skin, eyes, and nasal passages. The main metabolic pathway for acrolein is the alkylation of glutathione. The WHO suggests a 'tolerable oral acrolein intake' of 7.5 mg/day per kilogram of body weight. Although acrolein occurs in French fries, the levels are only a few micrograms per kilogram.",107-02-8,7847.0,C3H4O,56.02622,Greenish-yellow when impure,-87.7°C,52°C,212 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L121) ; inhalation  (L121) ; dermal (L121),"Acrolein rapidly and irreversibly binds to lysine moieties and sulfhydryl groups found on many cellular molecules forming thiol ethers. By this mechanism acrolein can bind to messenger compounds to produce direct cytotoxic effects or secondary effects from interrupted cell signaling pathways. Perturbation of inflammatory responses in bronchial epithelial cells was demonstrated by direct action of acrolein on the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B (IκB) kinase, which inhibits activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) transcription factor and suppresses interleukin 8 (IL-8) production. Rapid binding of acrolein to neural receptors in the corneal and nasal mucosa results in rapid depolarization of the associated neurons to produce ocular and nasal irritation. Acrolein also binds rapidly to glutathione, which may be inhibitory to the enzyme glutathione peroxidase and result in a lower level of cellular protection against oxygen radical toxicity. Further, the adduction of glutathione generates GS-propionaldehyde, which produces oxygen and possibly hydroxy radicals via cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase. Acrolein inhibits thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase, which disrupts the cellular thiol redox balance necessary for cell survival. It interferes with normal reverse cholesterol transport by high density lipoprotein (HDL) by modifying specific sites in apolipoprotein A-I. Acrolein also inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenases and activates the transient receptor potential cation channel. (L121, A84, A85, A86)","Acrolein can be absorbed though oral, inhalation, or dermal routes. In the liver and kidneys, acrolein forms conjugates with glutathione, cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, and/or thioredoxin. Acrolein can also be transformed into acrylic acid by liver cytosol or microsomes, or it can be oxidized to glycidaldehyde by lung or liver microsomes. Acrolein metabolites are excreted in the urine.

(L135)","Acrolein is used as a pesticide to control algae, weeds, bacteria, and mollusks. It is also used to make other chemicals, such as polyester resin, polyurethane, propylene glycol, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile, and glycerol. Small amounts of acrolein can be formed when trees, tobacco, other plants, gasoline, and oil are burned. (L121)","Acute Inhalation: 0.003 ppm (L134)

(L123),298-04-4,3118.0,C8H19O2PS3,274.02848,Colorless (pure) or dark yellow (technical grade) oil.,-25°C,,"0.0163 mg/mL at 20 °C [BOWMAN,BT & SANS,WW (1983A)]",Oral (L123) ; inhalation (L123) ; dermal (L123),"Disulfoton is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Metabolism of organophosphates occurs principally by oxidation, by hydrolysis via esterases and by reaction with glutathione. Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.","LD50: 25 mg/kg (Dermal, Rat) (T23)

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Depending on the amount of disulfoton that enters the body, effects on the nervous system, such as narrowing of the pupils, vomiting, diarrhea, drooling, difficulty in breathing, tremors, convulsions, and even death may occur. Skin contact with disulfoton may cause weakness and fatigue. (L123)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-03-06 18:57:58+00:00,2014-12-24 20:20:56+00:00,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfoton,,C18400,,38661.0,,D004222,Disulfoton,,,1916.0,True,CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC,C8H19O2PS3,"InChI=1S/C8H19O2PS3/c1-4-9-11(12,10-5-2)14-8-7-13-6-3/h4-8H2,1-3H3",InChIKey=DOFZAZXDOSGAJZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,274.404,274.028478434,Exogenous,Liquid,,,CHEMBL1332314,3006.0,,,,"Di-syston

23,25,39,46,T3D0045,Pentachlorophenol,"Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is an organochlorine compound used as a pesticide and a disinfectant. First produced in the 1930s, it is marketed under many trade names. It can be found in two forms: PCP itself or as the sodium salt of PCP, which dissolves easily in water. Short-term exposure to large amounts of PCP can cause harmful effects on the liver, kidneys, blood, lungs, nervous system, immune system, and gastrointestinal tract. Elevated temperature, profuse sweating, uncoordinated movement, muscle twitching, and coma are additional side effects. Contact with PCP (particularly in the form of vapor) can irritate the skin, eyes, and mouth. Long-term exposure to low levels such as those that occur in the workplace can cause damage to the liver, kidneys, blood, and nervous system. Finally exposure to PCP is also associated with carcinogenic, renal, and neurological effects. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Toxicity Class classifies PCP in group B2 (probable human carcinogen).",87-86-5,992.0,C6HCl5O,263.847,Colorless (pure) or dark gray to brown (inpure) solid.,174°C,309-310°C,0.014 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L127) ; inhalation (L127) ; dermal (L127),"Pentachlorophenol is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Pentachlorophenol is efficiently absorbed following inhalation, oral, and dermal exposure, then binds to plasma proteins and is distributed to the liver, lungs, kidneys, blood, fat tissues, and brain. Extensive plasma protein binding of pentachlorophenol may account for its low degree of metabolism. Metabolism of pentachlorophenol occurs in the liver, and the major pathways are conjugation to form the glucuronide and oxidative dechlorination to form tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ). Pentachlorophenol and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine. (L127)","LD50: 27 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T26)

Chronic Oral: 0.001 mg/kg/day (L134)","Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Exposure to high levels of pentachlorophenol can cause the cells in the body to produce excess heat, resulting in a very high fever, profuse sweating, and difficulty breathing. Contact with pentachlorophenol, particularly in the form of vapor can irritate the skin, eyes, and mouth. (L127, L128)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-03-06 18:57:58+00:00,2014-12-24 20:20:58+00:00,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pentachlorophenol,,C02575,,17642.0,CPD-10489,D010416,Pentachlorophenol,,PCI,1132.0,True,OC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)=C(Cl)C(Cl)=C1Cl,C6HCl5O,InChI=1S/C6HCl5O/c7-1-2(8)4(10)6(12)5(11)3(1)9/h12H,InChIKey=IZUPBVBPLAPZRR-UHFFFAOYSA-N,266.337,263.847003189,Exogenous,Solid,5.12,HMDB41974,CHEMBL75967,967.0,,,,"1-Hydroxy-2,3,4,5,6-pentachlorobenzene

All other toxic effects of carbon tetrachloride are related to its biotransformation via cytochrome P-450 enzymes, specifically CYP2E1. Metabolism of carbon tetrachloride by CYP2E1 may result in the destruction of the enzyme during the metabolic process, either by direct attack of radicals on the cytochrome(s) or highly localized lipid peroxidation resulting in detachment of P-450 proteins from the microsomal membranes. Reactive metabolites of carbon tetrachloride causes hepatic damage via haloalkylation of cellular macromolecules and lipid peroxidation. Carbon tetrachloride also perturbs the intracellular calcium homeostasis. Increased cytosolic levels of calcium may result from an influx of extracellular calcium caused by plasma membrane damage and decreased intracellular calcium sequestering. Higher levels of calcium activate enzymes such as proteases, which hydrolyze proteins in neighboring cells, leading to a progression of the lesion. Carbon tetrachloride's carcinogenicity is likely the result of certain reactive metabolites that bind to nuclear proteins, lipids, and DNA. (T10, L129)","Carbon tetrachloride is absorbed readily from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, and more slowly through the skin. It is distributed to all major organs, with highest concentrations in the fat, liver, bone marrow, adrenals, blood, brain, spinal cord, and kidney. Once carbon tetrachloride is absorbed, it is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 enzymes, with the production of the trichloromethyl radical. Aerobically, metabolism of the trichloromethyl radical can eventually form phosgene. Anaerobically, the radical can undergo reactions to form chloroform, hexachloroethane, or carbon monoxide. Carbon tetrachloride is excreted primarily in exhaled air and in the feces, with relatively minimal amounts in the urine.

It is composed of mainly monochlorobiphenyls (60.06%), and also includes bi-, tri, tetra-, and pentachlorinated homologs. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of 209 synthetic organic compounds with 1-10 chlorine atoms attached to biphenyl. PCBs were manufactured as commercial mixtures but banned in the 1970's because they were found to bioaccumulate in the environment and cause harmful health effects. However, PCBs do not break down readily and are still found in the environment. (L4)",11104-28-2,,C12H9Cl,,Clear oil.,,275–320 °C,"0.015 mg/mL at 25 °C [MABEY,WR et al.

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are trasported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin. Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The major metabolites are hydroxylated products which are excreted in the bile and faeces. The slow metabolism of PCBs means they tend to accumulate in body tissues.

26,28,43,50,T3D0049,Cobalt,"Cobalt has a molecular weight of 58.9 and an atomic number of 27. In the Periodic Table, close to other transition metals, it is situated in group 8, together with rhodium and iridium and it can occur in four oxidation states (0, +2, +3 and +4). The +2 and the ground state are the most common. Cobalt occurs in the minerals cobaltite (Co, Fe) AsS, smaltite (CoAs2), and erythrite Co3(AsO4)2.8H2O, and is often associated with nickel, silver, lead, copper, and iron ores, from which it is most frequently obtained as a by-product. Depending on the considered species, cobalt has multiple industrial applications including the production of alloys and hard metal, diamond polishing, drying agents, pigments and catalysts. Hard metal or cemented carbide is a powder metallurgical product consisting of hard, wear-resistant carbide particles bound together (cemented) with a ductile metal binder (i.e. metallic Co) by liquid phase sintering. Tungsten carbide (WC) is produced by mixing tungsten powder with pure carbon powder at high temperature; hereafter WC is mixed with Co powder to which paraffin is added as a binder. Depending on specific requirements related to their use, hard metals might additionally contain small quantities of chromium, niobium, molybdenum, titanium, tantalum or vanadium carbides. Inhalation and skin contact are the main occupational exposure routes. Occupational exposure to cobalt may result in adverse health effects in different organs or tissues, including the respiratory tract, the skin, the hemapoietic tissues, the myocardium or the thyroid gland. In addition, teratogenic and carcinogenic effects have been observed in experimental systems and/or in humans. For the general population, the diet constitutes the main route of exposure to cobalt, since it is an essential component of Vitamin B12 (hydroxycolalamin). Cobalt functions as a co-factor in enzyme catalysed reactions and is involved in the production of erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the formation of erythrocytes. This last property of cobalt was applied in the past as a therapy for anaemia. The carcinogenic potential of cobalt and its compounds was evaluated in 1991 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which concluded that there was inadequate evidence for carcinogenicity in humans (lung cancer) but sufficient evidence in experimental animal studies. In most experimental studies considered, the routes of exposure were, however, of questionable relevance for cancer risk assessment in humans for example, local sarcomas after intra-muscular injection. The general conclusion was that cobalt and its compounds are possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B). Since this evaluation, additional data have been accumulated which generally indicate that, depending on the considered cobalt species, different outcomes regarding toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity can be observed. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Co(II) ions are genotoxic in vitro and in vivo, and carcinogenic in rodents. Co metal is genotoxic in vitro. Hard metal dust, of which occupational exposure is linked to an increased lung cancer risk, is proven to be genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. Possibly, production of active oxygen species and/or DNA repair inhibition are mechanisms involved. Given the recently provided proof for in vitro and in vivo genotoxic potential of hard metal dust, the mechanistic evidence of elevated production of active oxygen species and the epidemiological data on increased cancer risk, it may be advisable to consider the possibility of a new evaluation by IARC.(A7687).",7440-48-4,104729.0,Co,58.933189,Grey metallic solid.,1495°C,3100°C (5612°F),,Inhalation (L29) ; oral (L29) ; dermal (L29),"Cobalt is believed to exhibit its toxicity through a oxidant-based and free radical-based processes. It produces oxygen radicals and may be oxidized to ionic cobalt, causing increased lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and inducing certain enzymes that lead to cell apoptosis. Cobalt has also been shown to block inorganic calcium channels, possibly impairing neurotransmission. Cobalt can also chelate lipoic acids, impairing oxidation of pyruvate or fatty acids. In addition, cobalt may inhibit DNA repair by interacting with zinc finger DNA repair proteins, and has also been shown to inhibit heme synthesis and glucose metabolism. Cobalt may activate specific helper T-lymphocyte cells and interact directly with immunologic proteins, such as antibodies (IgA and IgE) or Fc receptors, resulting in immunosensitization.

DDT reduces potassium transport across the membrane. DDT inhibits inactivation of the porous channels through which sodium ions pass. The channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization, causing a state of hyperexcitability. DDT inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. DDT also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron. DDT is also believed to adversely affect the reproductive system by mimicking endogenous hormones and binding to the estrogen and adrogen receptors. (T10, L85)","DDT is absorbed in the stomach and intestine, after which it enters the lymphatic system and is carried throughout the body and incorporated into fatty tissues. Metabolism of DDT occurs mainly via cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver and kidney, where it undergoes reductive dechlorination to DDD (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane) and DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene).

Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Metabolism of organophosphates occurs principally by oxidation, by hydrolysis via esterases and by reaction with glutathione. Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.","LD50: 66 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T14)

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","The symptoms associated with diazinon poisoning in humans include weakness, headaches, tightness in the chest, blurred vision, nonreactive pinpoint pupils, excessive salivation, difficulty breathing, sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and slurred speech.

Approximately 60% of inspired xylene is retained and approximately 90% of ingested xylene is absorbed. Absorption also occurs by the dermal route, but to a much lesser extent than by the inhalation and oral routes. Following absorption, xylene is rapidly distributed throughout the body by way of the systemic circulation. In the blood, it is primarily bound to serum proteins and accumulates primarily in adipose tissue. Xylene is primarily metabolized by oxidation of a methyl group and conjugation with glycine to yield the methylhippuric acid, whicih is the primary metabolite excreted in urine. Aromatic hydroxylation of xylene to xylenol occurs to only a limited extent in humans. Less than 2% of an absorbed dose is excreted in the urine as xylenol. Other minor metabolites found in urine include methylbenzyl alcohol and glucuronic acid conjugates of the oxidized xylene. In humans, hepatic microsomal CYP2E1 is the primary enzyme involved with the metabolism of xylene to methylbenzylalcohol, the dominant pathway leading to the formation of methylhippuric acid isomers. Unmetabolized xylene can be exhalated or also excreted in urine. (L165) ","LD50: 1590 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T18)

HPTE is an estrogen receptor alpha agonist, and also acts as an antagonist at the estrogen receptor beta and androgen receptor. This affects protein synthesis, which is believed to cause many of methoxychlor's estrogenic effects, such as decreased fertility. As methoxychlor is also a structural analogue of DDT, it is believed to have the same neurotoxic effects. This includes preventing the deactivation of the sodium gate after neuron activation and membrane depolarization, resulting in hyperexcitability of the nerve. Like DDT, methoxychlor may also inhibit neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase, which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. This contributes to the reduced rate of depolarization and increases the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron.

34,37,56,66,T3D0065,Chromium(VI) oxide,Chromium(VI) oxide is a chemical compound of hexavalent chromium. It is used mainly in electroplating. Hexavalent chromium is more toxic than other oxidation states of the chromium atom because of its greater ability to enter cells and higher redox potential.

The DNA damage may be caused by hydroxyl radicals produced during reoxidation of pentavalent chromium by hydrogen peroxide molecules present in the cell. Trivalent chromium may also form complexes with peptides, proteins, and DNA, resulting in DNA-protein crosslinks, DNA strand breaks, DNA-DNA interstrand crosslinks, chromium-DNA adducts, chromosomal aberrations and alterations in cellular signaling pathways. It has been shown to induce carcinogenesis by overstimulating cellular regulatory pathways and increasing peroxide levels by activating certain mitogen-activated protein kinases. It can also cause transcriptional repression by cross-linking histone deacetylase 1-DNA methyltransferase 1 complexes to CYP1A1 promoter chromatin, inhibiting histone modification. Chromium may increase its own toxicity by modifying metal regulatory transcription factor 1, causing the inhibition of zinc-induced metallothionein transcription. (A12, L16, A34, A35, A36)","Chromium is absorbed from oral, inhalation, or dermal exposure and distributes to nearly all tissues, with the highest concentrations found in kidney and liver. Bone is also a major storage site and may contribute to long-term retention. Hexavalent chromium's similarity to sulfate and chromate allow it to be transported into cells via sulfate transport mechanisms.

36,40,61,72,T3D0071,Toluene,"Toluene is found in allspice. Toluene is isolated from distilled tolu balsam (Myroxylon balsamum). Minor constituent of lime oil (Citrus aurantifolia).Toluene, formerly known as toluol, is a clear, water-insoluble liquid with the typical smell of paint thinners. It is an aromatic hydrocarbon that is widely used as an industrial feedstock and as a solvent. (Wikipedia) Toluene has been shown to exhibit beta-oxidant, depressant, hepatoprotective, anesthetic and neurotransmitter functions (A7693, A7694, A7695, A7696, A7697).",108-88-3,1140.0,C7H8,92.0626,Colorless liquid.,-95°C,110.6°C (231.1°F),0.526 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L174) ; inhalation (L174) ; dermal (L174),"Toluene is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Inhalation and ingestion are the primary routes of exposure, though toluene may also be absorbed through the skin. It accumulates rapidly in the brain and is subsequently deposited in other tissues according to their lipid content, with the highest levels attained in adipose tissue. The primary initial
steps in toluene metabolism is side-chain hydroxylation catalyzed predominately by the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2E1, followed by oxidation to benzoic acid. Most of the benzoic acid is then conjugated with glycine to form hippuric acid,
but a small portion can be conjugated with UDP-glucuronate to form the acyl-glucuronide. A very small portion of absorbed toluene can be converted by CYP1A2, CYP2B2, or CYP2E1 to ortho- or para-cresol. These metabolites are excreted in the urine, and the remaining toluene is exhaled unchanged. (T10, L174)","LD50: 5000 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T14)

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","The central nervous system is the primary target organ of toluene and other alkylbenzenes. Manifestations of exposure range from slight dizziness and headache to unconciousness, respiratory depression and death. Other symptoms include tiredness, confusion, weakness, memory loss, nausea, loss of appetite, and hearing and color vision loss. These symptoms usually disappear when exposure is stopped. (T10, L174)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-03-06 18:58:01+00:00,2014-12-24 20:21:02+00:00,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluene,,C01455,,17578.0,CPD-616,D014050,Toluene,DB01900,MBN,1391.0,True,CC1=CC=CC=C1,C7H8,"InChI=1S/C7H8/c1-7-5-3-2-4-6-7/h2-6H,1H3",InChIKey=YXFVVABEGXRONW-UHFFFAOYSA-N,92.1384,92.062600256,Exogenous,Liquid,2.73,HMDB34168,CHEMBL9113,1108.0,,"<p>Gregoire Kalopissis, Andree Bugaut, &#8220;2-Carbamylmethyl-or (diethylcarbamyl)methyl-amino-4-hydroxy toluene and process for preparing the same.&#8221; U.S. Patent US4101576, issued August, 1905.</p>",,"Methyl-Benzene

37,41,62,73,T3D0072,2-Oxohexane,"2-Oxohexane is a volatile organic compound. 2-Oxohexane is occasionally found as a volatile component of normal human biofluids. 2-Oxohexane is an hexacarbon solvent; the neurotoxicity of hexacarbon solvents has become apparent and an extensive literature has already developed as a result of the clinical and epidemiological implications of the human disease. The main neurological disorders associated with chronic volatile substance are peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar disease, chronic encephalopathy and dementia.

In addition, 2,5-hexanedione can covalently cross-links neurofilaments, causing large axonal swellings. (L176, A124, A125)","2-Hexanone is absorbed via ingestion, inhalation, and dermal routes, then distributed widely throughout the body, with the highest levels in the liver and blood. Metabolism is likely similar to that of other aliphatic ketones, proceeding via reduction to the corresponding secondary alcohol, 2-hexanol. An alternate pathway is oxidation to the corresponding alcohol, 5-hydroxy-2-hexanone, followed by further oxidation to the diketone 2,5-hexanedione. 2-Hexanone and its metabolites are excreted via exhalation or in the urine.

CDDs are a class of manufactured chemicals that consist of dioxin skeletel structures with chlorine substituents. They are also persistent organic pollutants (POPs), thus their production is regulated in most areas. Dioxins occur as by-products from the manufacture of organochlorides, the bleaching of paper, chlorination by waste and drinking water treatment plants, municipal solid waste and industrial incinerators, and natural sources such as volcanoes and forest fires.

(1988)]",Oral (L177) ; inhalation (L177) ; dermal (L177),"CDDs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor and subsequently alter the transcription of several genes (oncogenes, growth factors, receptors, hormones, and drug-metabolizing enzymes). The affinity for the Ah receptor depends on the structure of the specific CDD. The change in gene expression may result from the direct interaction of the Ah receptor and its heterodimer-forming partner, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, with gene regulatory elements or the initiation of a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade that subsequently activates other transcription factors. The change in transcription/translation of these genes is believed to be the cause of most of the toxic effects of CDDs. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin's carcinogenicity is thought to be the result of its ability to alter the capacity of both exogenous and endogenous substances to damage the DNA by inducing CYP1A1- and CYP1A2-dependent drug-metabolizing enzymes. (L177)","CDDs are absorbed through oral, inhalation, and dermal routes of exposure. CDDs are carried in the plasma by serum lipids and lipoproteins, and mainly distributed in the liver and adipose tissue. CDDs are slowly metabolized to polar metabolites by the microsomal monooxygenase system. These metabolites can undergo conjugation with glucuronic acid and glutathione. They may increase the rate of their own metabolism by inducing both phase I and phase II enzymes. The major routes of excretion of CDDs are the bile and the faeces, though smaller amounts are excreted in the urine and via lactation. (L177)","LD50: 201 ug/kg (Oral, Rat) (T26)

For example, Agent Blue, one of the chemicals used during the Vietnam War, is a mixture of cacodylic acid and sodium cacodylate. Sodium cacodylate is frequently used as a buffering agent in the preparation and fixation of biological samples for transmission electron microscopy. Cacodylic acid is highly toxic by ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact. Once thought to be a byproduct of inorganic arsenic detoxification, it is now believed to have serious health consequences of its own. It has been shown to be teratogenic in rodents, most often causing cleft palate but also fetal fatality at high doses. It has been shown to be genotoxic in human cells, causing apoptosis and also decreased DNA production and shorter DNA strands. While not itself a strong carcinogen, cacodylic acid does promote tumors in the presence of carcinogens in organs such as the kidneys and liver.

At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase and uncouples the oxidative phosphorylation by competing with phosphate. This leads to inhibition of energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is increased, leading to oxidative stress due to the formation of reactive oxygen species. Arsenic's carginogenicity is influenced by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. The binding of other arsenic protein targets may also cause altered DNA repair enzyme activity, altered DNA methylation patterns and cell proliferation.

41,45,68,79,T3D0078,Naphthalene,"Naphthalene is the simplest polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) consisting of two fused benzene rings. It has a distinct, pungent odor that can be detected at levels as low as 0.08 ppm.  Naphthalene is the most abundant single component of coal tar so most of it is now industrially derived from coal tar. From the 1960s until the 1990s, significant amounts of naphthalene were also produced from heavy petroleum fractions during petroleum refining, but today petroleum-derived naphthalene represents only a minor component of naphthalene production. Naphthalene is also produced naturally with trace amounts of naphthalene being produced by black walnuts, magnolias and specific types of deer, as well as the Formosan subterranean termite. Some strains of the endophytic fungus (Muscodor albus) also produce naphthalene. Naphthalene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are released from incomplete combustion processes originating in industry, cigarette smoke and motor vehicle exhaust, as well as natural events such as forest fires. Industrially, naphthalene is used in the production of phthalic anhydride, as a solvent for chemical reactions, as a wetting agent and as a fumigant.  It is also used in pyrotechnic special effects such as the generation of black smoke and simulated explosions. In the past, naphthalene was administered orally to kill parasitic worms in livestock. Naphthalene was once the primary ingredient in mothballs, though its use has largely been replaced in favor of alternatives such as 1,4-dichlorobenzene. In a sealed container containing naphthalene pellets, naphthalene vapors build up to levels that are toxic to both the adult and larval forms of many moths. Naphthalene has been shown to exhibit apoptotic and catabolic functions (4, 5). Exposure to large amounts of naphthalene may damage or destroy red blood cells. Humans, in particular children, have developed this condition, known as hemolytic anemia, after ingesting mothballs or deodorant blocks containing naphthalene.",91-20-3,931.0,C10H8,128.0626,White crystals.,80.3°C,218°C (424.4°F),0.031 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L10); inhalation (L10),"PAH's such as naphthalene are transported throughout the body after binding blood proteins such as albumin. Binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor or glycine N-methyltransferase induces the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes (especially CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1). These cytochrome enzymes metabolize PAH's into various toxic intermediates (epoxide intermediates, dihydrodiols, phenols, quinones, and their various combinations). The reactive metabolites of PAHs covalently bind to DNA and other cellular macromolecules, initiating mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. (10, 12, 2, 3). In humans, the metabolite alpha-naphthol has been linked to the development of hemolytic anemia in some cases following ingestion or extensive dermal or inhalation exposure. Susceptibility appears to be exacerbated by a deficiency in the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme, or G-6-PD. Over 400 million people have an inherited condition called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Exposure to naphthalene is more harmful for these people and may cause hemolytic anemia at lower doses. Some naphthalene metabolites deplete glutathione stores in affected tissues such as the lungs, leading to toxicity. The metabolites responsible for glutathione depletion have been identified as naphthalene oxide or 1,2-naphthoquinone and 1,4-naphthoquinone.","PAH metabolism occurs in all tissues, usually by cytochrome P-450 and its associated enzymes. PAHs are metabolized into reactive intermediates, which include epoxide intermediates, dihydrodiols, phenols, quinones, and their various combinations. The phenols, quinones, and dihydrodiols can be conjugated to glucuronides and sulfate esters; and the quinones can form glutathione conjugates. (L10)","LD50: 490 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T29)

Hemolysis, the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells, may occur following ingestion or sufficient dermal exposure to either naphthalene or to naphthalene-treated fabric. In humans, cataracts and other ocular injury have been reported following acute and chronic occupational exposure to naphthalene. Additional signs of toxicity in children include convulsions and coma. Infants may develop encephalopathy and kernicterus, a form of brain damage, due to the presence of increased levels of methemoglobin, hemoglobin, and bilirubin in their plasma. Naphthalene appears to be mildly carcinogenic. Rats exposed to naphthalene vapors at 10, 30, or 60 ppm for 6 hours a day, five days a week for two years developed respiratory epithelial adenomas and olfactory epithelial neuroblastomas.","Symptoms of hemolytic anemia include fatigue, lack of appetite, restlessness, and pale skin.

The conjugation of 1,2-dichloroethane with glutathione is catalyzed primarily by glutathione S-transferases. 1,2-Dichloroethane appears to be activated to mutagenic species to a lesser extent by the hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzyme system. Reactive metabolites of 1,2-dichloroethane produced by hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 can bind to cellular proteins and DNA. It has been suggested that 1,2-dichloroethane-induced toxicity occurs when the biotransformation processes are saturated, thereby allowing higher levels of 1,2-dichloroethane to circulate throughout the body and conjugate with glutathione instead of being detoxified and eliminated. (L156, A113)","Due to its physical properties such as its lipophilicity, 1,2-dichloroethane is likely to be absorbed across the alveolar membranes of the lung, mucosal membranes of the gastrointestinal tract, and the skin by passive diffusion. Once in the body, it is widely distributed, with the greatest amounts accumulating in the more lipophilic tissues. The primary route of biotransformation involves conjugation with glutathione to yield nonvolatile urinary metabolites. The other route, a cytocrome P-450-mediated oxidation is responsible for the formation of chloroacetaldehyde. Metabolic saturation appears to occur sooner after oral (gavage) administration than after inhalation exposure. Following inhalation or oral exposure, elimination of 1,2-dichloroethane occurs primarily via excretion of soluble metabolites in the urine and excretion of unchanged parent compound and carbon dioxide in the expired air.

Thiocyanates are found in various foods and plants and are produced primarily from the reaction of free cyanide with sulfur. This reaction occurs in the environment (for example, in industrial waste streams that contain cyanide) and in the human body after cyanide ingestion. Thiocyanates are present in water primarily because of discharges from coal processing, extraction of gold and silver, and mining industries. Thiocyanate is the major product formed from cyanide that passes into the body as the body attempts to rid itself of cyanide. (L191)",302-04-5,781.0,CNS,57.97514,White powder.,,,,Oral (L191); inhalation (L191) ;  dermal (L191) ,"Thiocyanate (sulphocyanate or SCN) is believed to be a goitrogenic compound. It is a competitive inhibitor of the human thyroid sodium/iodide symporter NIS. Thus, the adverse effects of thiocyanate overload are especially noticeable when iodine availability is low. Intake of goitrogenic substances causes an adaptive increase in T3‰ЫЄs binding to brain nuclear receptors and in the activity of type II 5'-deiodinase, which generates T3 from T4. This altered function and availability of T3 is detrimental to the developing brain. Thiocyanate is also known to modulate activity of mammalian peroxidases. For instance, eosinophil peroxidase has been implicated in promoting oxidative tissue damage in a variety of inflammatory conditions, including asthma. Thiocyanate also acts as inhibitor to carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzes the rapid conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. (A139, A143, A149) Organic nitriles decompose into cyanide ions both in vivo and in vitro. Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)","Thiocyanates can appear in the body after metabolization of cyanides by rhodanese. When thiocyanates enter the body, they normally breaks down in aqueous solution to yield sulfate ions. However, thiocyanates are also found in the thyroid fluids. Immediately following exposure to thiocyanate containing solutions, the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator Cl‰ЫТ channel exhibits high unitary SCN‰ЫТ conductance and anomalous mole fraction behaviour. Thiocyanates is normally excreted in urine. (A140, A142, A143, A144) Organic nitriles are converted into cyanide ions through the action of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. Cyanide is rapidly absorbed and distributed throughout the body. Cyanide is mainly metabolized into thiocyanate by either rhodanese or 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase. Cyanide metabolites are excreted in the urine. (L96)","Guanidine Thiocyanate: LD50: 375 mg/kg (Oral, Rat), LD50: 2000 mg/kg (Dermal, Rabbit) (L218)

Thiocyanates are present in water primarily because of discharges from coal processing, extraction of gold and silver, and mining industries. Thiocyanate is the major product formed from cyanide that passes into the body as the body attempts to rid itself of cyanide, thus exposure to cyanide also results in exposure to thiocyanate.

This inhibits uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, resulting in a deficiency of the decarboxylation of uroporphyrinogen III and accumulation of uroporphyrins in the liver. In addition, metabolism of hexachlorobenzene by the cytochrome P-450 enzymes is believed to produce reactive electrophilic metabolites that covalently bind to cellular proteins and DNA, causing irreversible damage. Exposure to hexochlorobenzene also causes macrophages to be attracted to organs such as the spleen, lungs, and skin, where they become activated by the hexochlorobenzene. This leads to a cascade of reactions involving innate immune cells. The gene expression profiles provide evidence for the importance of macrophages and granulocytes and mediators released by these cells in the adverse inflammatory response against hexochlorobenzene. In this way, co-stimulatory or danger signals are generated that could polyclonally activate T cells. Hexachlorobenzene is a weak agonist for aryl hydrocarbon receptor and may exhibit some of its toxic effects by activating the gene-regulatory properties of this protein, possibly inducing cytochome P-450 enzymes. It may also act at certain endocrine receptors. (A14, L225, A156, A157, A60)","Hexachlorobenzene is mainly absorbed via ingestion, but also through inhalation and oral routes. It preferentially distributes to adipose tissue and other organs with high fat content. In animals, hexachlorobenzene is slowly metabolized to pentachlorophenol by the hepatic cytochrome P-450 system, conjugated with glutathione to yield pentachlorothiophenol, or reductively dechlorinated to form pentachlorobenzene. Other metabolites include less chlorinated benzenes, chlorophenols, S-conjugated phenols, and benzenes. Hexachlorobenzene is slowly metabolized in mammals, and the majority of hexachlorobenzene is excreted unchanged in the feces, while metabolites are excreted in the urine.

47,51,81,95,T3D0094,"2,4-Dinitrotoluene","2,4-Dinitrotoluene is the most common of the six dinitrotoluene isomers. Dinitrotoluene (DNT) or Dinitro is an explosive with the formula C6H3(CH3)(NO2)2. At room temperature it is a pale yellow to orange crystalline solid. It is a high explosive and one of the precursors for trinitrotoluene (TNT), which is synthesized through three separate nitrations of toluene. The first product is mononitrotoluene, DNT is the second, and TNT is the third and final product. (L270)",121-14-2,8461.0,C7H6N2O4,182.03276,At room temperature it is a pale yellow to orange crystalline solid.

High levels of methemoglobin are removed by catabolism, leading to the development of anemia. Some metabolites of 2,4-DNT are also transported back from the bile to the liver, where the amine group is N-hydroxylated by cytochrome P-450 to form an unstable sulfate conjugate. The sulfate conjugate is degraded into carbonium or nitrenium ions. These ions covalently bind to hepatic macromolecules (DNA, RNA), leading to mutations and subsequently liver tumors. They also bind to DNA of the lung and the intestine. (L276, T45, A171, L280)","2,4-Dinitrotoluene can be inhalated as fumes or dust, ingested, or absorbed after contact with the skin. Bioactivation of 2,4-DNT is thought to occur by the following processes: The methyl group is oxidized to an alcohol by a cytochrome P-450 dependent pathway; the benzyl alcohol is conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in the bile. Intestinal microflora hydrolyzes the glucuronide and reduces one nitro group, forming an aminonitrobenzyl alcohol which can be readsorbed from the intestine. The amino group is oxidized to an hydroxylamine by hepatic enzymes and conjugated with sulfate, by sulfotransferase. Decomposition of the sulfate ester yields a highly electrophilic nitrenium (or carbonium) ion which can react with DNA and other biological nucleophiles. The major metabolite found in human urine is 2,4-dinitrobenzyl alcohol or its glucuronide conjugate. Other urinary metabolites include 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid, 4-(N-acetyl)amino-2nitrobenzoic acid, and 2-amino-4-nitrobenzoic acid. The latter two are clearly the product of both oxidative and reductive metabolism. Metabolism is also believed to involve O-acetyltransferase (which transfers the acetyl group of 2,4-DNT) and cytosolic xanthine oxidase (which reduces 2,4-DNT). Small traces of unmetabolized 2,4-DNT can be observed in the urine too. (L276, A169, T47, A170, A177, A178)","LD50: 268 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T14)

48,52,84,100,T3D0099,Ethylbenzene,"Ethylbenzene is an organic compound with the formula C6H5CH2CH3. This aromatic hydrocarbon is important in the petrochemical industry as an intermediate in the production of styrene, which in turn is used for making polystyrene, a commonly used plastic material. Although often present in small amounts in crude oil, ethylbenzene is produced in bulk quantities by combining benzene and ethylene in an acid-catalyzed chemical reaction. It is one ingredient of cigarette. The acute toxicity of ethylbenzene is low, with an LD50 of about 4 grams per kilogram of body weight. The longer term toxicity and carcinogenicity is ambiguous. Eye and throat sensitivity can occur when high level exposure to ethylbenzene in the air occurs. At higher level exposure, ethylbenzene can cause dizziness.",100-41-4,7500.0,C8H10,106.07825,,-94.9°C,,"0.169 mg/mL at 25 °C [SANEMASA,I et al.

Ethybenzene inhibits the activity of the astrocytic membrane ATPases, which helps regulate adequate intercellular levels of ions, nutrients, metabolic intermediates and precursors in the central nervous system. Thus, this may disturb the ability of the cells to maintain homeostasis. (L311, A186)","Ethylbenzene is metabolized mainly through hydroxylation and then through conjugation reactions from which numerous metabolites have been isolated. Hydroxylation of ethylbenzene to 1-phenylethanol is catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 isoforms CYP2E1 and CYP2B6. 1-Phenylethanol is conjugated to glucuronide, which then is either excreted or converted to subsequent metabolites. Oxidation of 1-phenylethanol yields acetophenone, which is both excreted in the urine as a minor metabolite and further transformed. Continued oxidation of the side chain leads to the sequential formation of 2-hydroxyacetophenone, 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol, mandelic acid, and phenylglyoxylic acid. Minor pathways (e.g., ring hydroxylation) include glucuronide and sulfate conjugation with hydroxylated derivatives to form glucuronides and sulfates that are excreted in the urine. In humans exposed via inhalation, the major metabolites of ethylbenzene in the urine are mandelic acid (70%) and phenylglyoxylic acid (25%). Following dermal exposure of humans, however, excretion of mandelic acid was shown to be only 4.6% of the absorbed dose, which may indicate differences in the metabolic fate between inhalation and dermal exposure routes.

Acute duration and intermediate duration studies suggest that the auditory system is a sensitive target of ethylbenzene toxicity. Exposure ethylbenzene can lead to functional and organic disturbances (nervous system disturbances, toxic hepatitis and upper respiratory tract complaints). Metabolites of ethylbenzene have been shown to produce oxidative damage to DNA. (L311, T52)","Cough, sore throat, dizziness, drowsiness, and headache follow inhalation or ingestion exposure to ethylbenzene. Ingestion exposure can also lead to burning sensation in the throat and chest. Skin or eyes contact to ethylbenzene can lead to redness and pain of the exposed surface. (L316)","Following oral exposure, a gastric lavage is recommended. Protect airway by placement in Trendelenburg and left lateral decubitus position or by endotracheal intubation. Control any seizures first. Following inhalation, move patient to fresh air. Monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Following eye exposure, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. In case of dermal exposure, remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed area thoroughly with soap and water. Treat dermal irritation or burns with standard topical therapy. Patients developing dermal hypersensitivity reactions may require treatment with systemic or topical corticosteroids or antihistamines. Some chemicals can produce systemic poisoning by absorption through intact skin. Carefully observe patients with dermal exposure for the development of any systemic signs or symptoms and administer symptomatic treatment as necessary.

It primarily targets the central nervous system, particularily the globus pallidus of the basal ganglia. It is believed that the manganese ion, Mn(II), enhances the autoxidation or turnover of various intracellular catecholamines, leading to increased production of free radicals, reactive oxygen species, and other cytotoxic metabolites, along with a depletion of cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms, leading to oxidative damage and selective destruction of dopaminergic neurons. In addition to dopamine, manganese is thought to interact with other neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glutamate. Manganese overwhelms the manganese superoxide dismutase and produce oxidative damage. The neurotoxicity of Mn(II) has also been linked to its ability to substitute for Ca(II) under physiological conditions. It can enter mitochondria via the calcium uniporter and inhibit mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. It may also inhibit the efflux of Ca(II), which can result in a loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity. Mn(II) has been shown to inhibit mitochondrial aconitase activity to a significant level, altering amino acid metabolism and cellular iron homeostasis. (L228)","Manganese is mainly absorbed via ingestion, but can also be inhaled. It binds to alpha-2-macroglobulin, albumin, or transferrin in the plasma and is distributed to the brain and all other mammalian tissues, though it tends to accumulate more in the liver, pancreas, and kidney. Manganese exists in a number of oxidation states and is believed to undergo changes in oxidation state within the body. Manganese oxidation state can influence tissue toxicokinetic behavior, and possibly toxicity. Manganese is excreted primarily in the faeces.

56,61,107,124,T3D0123,Methylmercury,"Methylmercury is an organometallic cation. It is formed by the burning of wastes and fossil fuels containing inorganic mercury, as well as by the action of anaerobic organisms on inorganic mercury. It is particularily hazardous due to its ability to bioaccumulate in the environment, particularily in aquatic systems. (L260)",22967-92-6,6860.0,CH3Hg,,White powder.,,,,Oral (L7) ; inhalation (L7) ; dermal (L7),"Methylmercury is neurotoxic. It potently affects the release of neurotransmitter from presynaptic nerve terminals. Methylmercury alters calcium ion concentrations by at least two mechanisms. First, it disrupts regulation of Ca2+ from an intracellular Ca2+ pool and second, it increases the permeability of the plasma membrane to Ca2+. Methylmercury also blocks plasma membrane voltage-dependent Ca2+ and Na+ channels in addition to activating a nonspecific transmembrane cation conductance. Chronic Methylmercury exposure results in ultrastructural changes and accumulation of Methylmercury within mitochondria. In vitro, Methylmercury inhibits several mitochondrial enzymes and depolarizes the mitochondria membrane subsequently reducing ATP production and Ca2+ buffering capacity. Inhibition of protein synthesis is observed after in vivo or in vitro exposures of Methylmercury and may be an early effect of Methylmercury poisoning. Organic mercury exerts developmental effects by binding to tubulin, preventing microtubule assembly and causing mitotic inhibition (A15097)","Ingested methylmercury is readily and completely absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. Methylmercury has a half-life in human blood of about 50 days. Organic mercury complexes with free cysteine and the cysteine and sulfhydryl groups on proteins such as haemoglobin. The methylmercuric-cysteinyl complex is recognized by amino acid transporting proteins in the body as methionine, another essential amino acid. Because of this mimicry, it is transported freely throughout the body including across the blood–brain barrier and across the placenta, where it is absorbed by the developing fetus. Also for this reason as well as its strong binding to proteins, methylmercury is not readily eliminated.  Because methylmercury is formed in aquatic systems and because it is not readily eliminated from organisms it is biomagnified. Organic mercury is metabolized into inorganic mercury, which is eventually excreted in the urine and faeces. (6)","LD50: 58 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T41)

It bioaccumulates in aquatic systems and exposure can result from ingesting contaminated fish. (L260),Chronic Oral: 0.00005 mg/kg (L134),"Mercury mainly affects the nervous system. Exposure to high levels of metallic, inorganic, or organic mercury can permanently damage the brain, kidneys, and developing fetus. Effects on brain functioning may result in irritability, shyness, tremors, changes in vision or hearing, and memory problems. Acrodynia, a type of mercury poisoning in children, is characterized by pain and pink discoloration of the hands and feet. Mercury poisoning can also cause Hunter-Russell syndrome and Minamata disease. (L7)","Chronic Exposure:Common symptoms include peripheral neuropathy, skin discoloration, edema, and desquamation. (1) 
Acute Exposure: Symptoms of ingestion within the first few minutes may include pain, profuse vomiting and severe purging and the victim may die within a few hours from peripheral vascular collapse secondary to fluid and electrolyte loss. Primary gastroenteritis may subside spontaneously within a few days but severe hemorrhagic inflammation of the colon (colitis) has occurred as late as 9 days following ingestion. A second phase developing over 1-3 days is characterized by stomatitis (lesions of the mouth parts), membranous colitis and kidney damage (tubular nephritis). This second phase is associated with a slow and prolonged excretion of mercury by salivary glands, the gastrointestinal mucosa and kidneys. Death in this phase usually occurs as a result of kidney failure.
","Mercury poisoning is treated by immediate decontamination and chelation therapy using DMSA, DMPS, DPCN, or dimercaprol.

57,62,111,128,T3D0127,Chlorpyrifos,"Chlorpyrifos (IUPAC name: O,O-diethyl O-3,5,6-trichloropyridin-2-yl phosphorothioate) is a crystalline organophosphate insecticide. It was introduced in 1965 by Dow Chemical Company and is known by many trade names (see table), including Dursban and Lorsban. It acts on the nervous system of insects by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. Chlorpyrifos is moderately toxic to humans, and exposure has been linked to neurological effects, persistent developmental disorders, and autoimmune disorders. Exposure during pregnancy retards the mental development of children, and most use in homes has been banned since 2001 in the U.S. In agriculture, it remains one of the most widely used organophosphate insecticides, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).",2921-88-2,2730.0,C9H11Cl3NO3PS,348.92628,White crystals.,42°C,,0.00112 mg/mL at 24°C,Oral (L268) ; inhalation (L268) ; dermal (L268),"Chlorpyrifos is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Metabolism of organophosphates occurs principally by oxidation, by hydrolysis via esterases and by reaction with glutathione. Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.","LD50: 102 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T42)

(L135),"Chlorpyrifos is used as a pesticide. In the home, it is used to control cockroaches, fleas, and termites; it is also used in some pet flea and tick collars. On the farm, it is used to control ticks on cattle and as a spray to control crop pests. (L268)","Acute Oral: 0.003 mg/kg/day (L134)
Intermediate Oral: 0.003 mg/kg/day (L134)
Chronic Oral: 0.001 mg/kg/day (L134)","Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Chlorpyrifos exposure may produce a variety of effects on the nervous system including headaches, blurred vision, lacrimation, excessive salivation, runny nose, dizziness, confusion, muscle weakness or tremors, nausea, diarrhea, and sudden changes in heart rate. High levels may result in severe sweating, loss of bowel control, severe muscle tremors, seizures, loss of consciousness, coma, or death. (L268)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-03-06 18:58:07+00:00,2014-12-24 20:21:10+00:00,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorpyrifos,,C14322,,34631.0,,D004390,Chlorpyrifos,,,465.0,True,CCOP(=S)(OCC)OC1=C(Cl)C=C(Cl)C(Cl)=N1,C9H11Cl3NO3PS,"InChI=1S/C9H11Cl3NO3PS/c1-3-14-17(18,15-4-2)16-9-7(11)5-6(10)8(12)13-9/h5H,3-4H2,1-2H3",InChIKey=SBPBAQFWLVIOKP-UHFFFAOYSA-N,350.586,348.926283546,Exogenous,Solid,4.96,HMDB41856,CHEMBL463210,2629.0,,,,"Bonidel

58,64,119,136,T3D0135,Guthion,"Guthion, also called azinphos-methyl, is a synthetic organophosphorous pesticide. It has been used on many different crops, especially apples, pears, cherries, peaches, almonds, and cotton. Due to its toxicity, its use has been banned or tightly regulated in most areas today. (L580)",86-50-0,2268.0,C10H12N3O3PS2,317.00577,Colorless to white crystals.,73°C,,"0.0209 mg/mL at 20 °C [BOWMAN,BT & SANS,WW (1983)]",Oral (L580) ; dermal (L580) ; inhalation (L580) ,"Guthion is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Metabolism of organophosphates occurs principally by oxidation, by hydrolysis via esterases and by reaction with glutathione. Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.","LD50: 11 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T87)

Chronic Oral: mg/kg/day (L134)","Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Guthion interferes with the nerves and brain normal way. Exposure to very high levels of guthion for a short period in air, water, or food may cause difficulty breathing, chest tightness, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea, blurred vision, sweating, headaches, dizziness, loss of consciousness, and death. (L580)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-03-06 18:58:08+00:00,2014-12-24 20:21:11+00:00,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azinphos-methyl,,C11018,,2953.0,,D001387,Guthion,,,123.0,True,COP(=S)(OC)SCN1N=NC2=CC=CC=C2C1=O,C10H12N3O3PS2,"InChI=1S/C10H12N3O3PS2/c1-15-17(18,16-2)19-7-13-10(14)8-5-3-4-6-9(8)11-12-13/h3-6H,7H2,1-2H3",InChIKey=CJJOSEISRRTUQB-UHFFFAOYSA-N,317.324,317.005769157,Exogenous,Solid,,,CHEMBL530115,2181.0,,,,"3-(Mercaptomethyl)-1,2,3-benzotriazin-4(3H)-one, O,O-dimethyl phosphorodithioate

The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of OP exposure.","LD50: 97 mg/kg (Dermal, Rabbit) (T13)

It was registered for use on cotton as a defoliant. (L331)",,"Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, excessive salivation, headache, giddiness, vertigo and weakness. Rhinorrhea and sensation of tightness in chest are common in inhalation exposure. Blurring or dimness of vision, miosis, tearing, ciliary muscle spasm, loss of accommodation, ocular pain, and mydriasis may also occur.

If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

It is a dense, mobile, slightly transparent reddish-brown liquid, that evaporates easily at standard temperature and pressures to give an orange vapor (its color resembles nitrogen dioxide) that has a strongly disagreeable odor resembling that of chlorine. It is one of only two elements on the periodic table that are known to be liquids at room temperature (the other being mercury). Bromine is corrosive and toxic, with properties between those of chlorine and iodine. Free bromine does not occur in nature, but occurs as colorless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous to table salt. Bromine is used in the preparation of brominated flame retardants, it is also used in the preparation of gas additives and pesticides. Bromide compounds, especially potassium bromide, were frequently used as general sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Bromides in the form of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine, although the latter use varies from country to country. Bromine has been long believed to have no essential function in mammals, but recent research suggests that bromine is necessary for tissue development. In addition, bromine is used preferentially over chlorine by one antiparasitic enzyme in the human immune system. Organobromides are needed and produced enzymatically from bromide by some lower life forms in the sea, particularly algae.

It may reduce potassium transport across the membrane. Dicofol also alters the porous channels through which sodium ions pass. These channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization. Dicofol inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. Dicofol also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron. Difocol is also an endocrine disruptor and binds both the androgen and estrogen receptor. In addition, it may alter sex hormone metabolism by directly inhibiting cytochrome P-450 19A1. Difocol is able to competitively bind transthyretin, which lowers plasma thyroid hormone levels. (T10, A214, A228, A229)","Dicofol can be absorbed via oral, inhahation, and dermal routes.

63,69,128,146,T3D0145,Parathion,"Parathion is a highly toxic cholinesterase inhibitor that is used as an acaricide and as an insecticide, generally applied by spraying, most often to cotton, rice, and fruit trees. Also called parathion-ethyl or diethyl parathion, parathion is an organophosphate compound. As parathion is highly toxic to non-target organisms, its use is banned or restricted in many areas. (L633)",56-38-2,991.0,C10H14NO5PS,291.03303,White crystals.,6.1°C,,0.011 mg/mL,Oral(L633) ; inhalation (L633) ; dermal (L633).,"Parathion is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Metabolism of organophosphates occurs principally by oxidation, by hydrolysis via esterases and by reaction with glutathione. Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.","LD50: 2 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T14)

(L135)","Parathion is an insecticide and acaricide that is generally applied by spraying, most often to cotton, rice, and fruit trees. (L633)",,"Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Parathion exposure can result in headaches, convulsions, poor vision, vomiting, abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, unconsciousness, tremor, dyspnea, and finally lung-edema as well as respiratory arrest. (L633)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-03-06 18:58:10+00:00,2014-12-24 20:21:13+00:00,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathion,,C06604,,27928.0,PARATHION,D010278,Parathion,,,1126.0,True,CCOP(=S)(OCC)OC1=CC=C(C=C1)N(=O)=O,C10H14NO5PS,"InChI=1S/C10H14NO5PS/c1-3-14-17(18,15-4-2)16-10-7-5-9(6-8-10)11(12)13/h5-8H,3-4H2,1-2H3",InChIKey=LCCNCVORNKJIRZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,291.261,291.033029765,Exogenous,Liquid,3.83,HMDB01355,CHEMBL261919,13844817.0,,,,"Alkron

64,70,130,148,T3D0147,Selenium,"Selenium is a nonmetal element with the atomic number 34 and the chemical symbol Se. Isolated selenium occurs in several different forms, the most stable of which is a dense purplish-gray semiconductor form. Selenium rarely occurs in its elemental state in nature and is usually found in sulfide ores such as pyrite, partially replacing the sulfur in the ore matrix. It may also be found in silver, copper, lead, and nickel minerals. Selenium is mainly used in the electronics industry, in glassmaking, and in chemicals and pigments. Though selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, trace amounts of the element are necessary for cellular function in most animals, forming the active center of the enzymes glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, and three known deiodinase enzymes. (L620)",7782-49-2,107674.0,Se,79.916519,Gray to black crystals.,221°C,684.9°C (1264.8°F),,Oral(L619) ; inhalation (L619) ; dermal (L619).,"Selenium readily substitutes for sulfur in biomolecules and in many biochemical reactions, especially when the concentration of selenium is high and the concentration of sulfur is low. Inactivation of the sulfhydryl enzymes necessary for oxidative reactions in cellular respiration, through effects on mitochondrial and microsomal electron transport, might contribute to acute selenium toxicity. Selenomethionine (a common organic selenium compound) also appears to randomly substitute for methionine in protein synthesis. This substitution may affect the structure and functionability of the protein, for example, by altering disulfide bridges. Inorganic forms of selenium appear to react with tissue thiols by redox catalysis, resulting in formation of reactive oxygen species and causing damage by oxidative stress. (L619)","Selenium may be absorbed through inhalation and ingestion, while some selenium compounds may also be absorbed dermally. Once in the body, selenium is distributed mainly to the liver and kidney. Selenium is an essential micronutrient and is a component of glutathione peroxidase, iodothyronine 5'-deiodinases, and thioredoxin reductase. Organic selenium is first metabolized into inorganic selenium. Inorganic selenium is reduced stepwise to the intermediate hydrogen selenide, which is either incorporated into selenoproteins after being transformed to selenophosphate and selenocysteinyl tRNA or excreted into the urine after being transformed into methylated metabolites of selenide. Elemental selenium is also methylated before excretion. Selenium is primarily eliminated in the urine and feces, but certain selenium compounds may also be exhaled.

It may also be found in pigments in plastics, paints, enamels, inks, and rubber. (L619)",Chronic Oral: 0.005 mg/kg/day (L134),"Chronic oral exposure to high concentrations of selenium compounds can produce a disease called selenosis. The major signs of selenosis are hair loss, nail brittleness, and neurological abnormalities (such as numbness and other odd sensations in the extremities). Animal studies have shown that selenium may also affect sperm production and the female reproductive cycle. (L619)","Short-term oral exposure to high concentrations of selenium may cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

66,72,132,152,T3D0151,"O,P'-DDD","DDD, O,P'- is an isomer of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, an organochlorine insecticide. It is a component of commercial mixtures of DDT. DDT was once a widely used pesticide, but today its agricultural use has been banned worldwide due to its toxicity and tendency to bioaccumulate. However, it still has limited use in disease vector control. (L84). It is a derivative of the insecticide  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane that specifically inhibits cells of the adrenal cortex and their production of hormones. It is used to treat adrenocortical tumors and causes CNS damage, but no bone marrow depression. [PubChem]",53-19-0,4211.0,C14H10Cl4,317.95366,White powder.,77°C,,0.1 mg/L (at 25°C),Oral (L85); about 40% oral Lysodren is absorbed.,"DDD toxicity occurs via at least four mechanisms, possibly all functioning simultaneously. DDD reduces potassium transport across the membrane. DDD inhibits the inactivation of voltaged-gated sodium channels. The channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization and resulting in a state of hyperexcitability. DDD inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. DDD also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron. DDD is also believed to adversely affect the reproductive system by mimicking endogenous hormones and binding to the estrogen and adrogen receptors. (T10, L85)","DDD is absorbed in the stomach and intestine, after which it enters the lymphatic system and is carried throughout the body and incorporated into fatty tissues. Metabolism of DDD occurs mainly via cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver and kidney. Its metabolites, mainly DDA (bis(p-chlorophenyl) acetic acid), are excreted in the urine. (L85)Route of Elimination: A variable amount of metabolite (1%-17%) is excreted in the bile and the balance is apparently stored in the tissues.Half Life: 18-159 days","LD50: 113 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L138)",5 g/kg for an adult human. (L138),"Not directly listed by IARC, but carcinogenicity studies of this DDT metabolite are discussed in connection with DDT (L2151).","DDD is found in DDT, which is used as a pesticide and in disease vector control. (L84). It is also used for treatment of inoperable adrenocortical tumours; Cushing's syndrome",,"DDT has been shown to cause mild anemia. Exposure to DDT causes loss of weight and anorexia. DDT poisoning affects CNS function in humans, but pathologic changes are observed in the liver and reproductive organs. Hypertrophy of hepatocytes and subcellular organelles such as mitochondria, proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, centrolobular necrosis after exposure to high concentrations, and an increase in the incidence of hepatic tumors have been noted. (T10)",DDT exposure causes ataxia and abnormal stepping. Acute signs of DDT poisoning include paresthesia after oral ingestion. Studies have shown that a mammal poisoned with DDT-type agents displays periodic persistent tremoring and/or convulsive seizures that are suggestive of repetitive discharges in neurons. These repetitive tremors and seizures can be initiated by tactile and auditory stimuli. (T10),"Treatment of DDT exposure should be primarily directed towards decontamination and supportive care, as there is no specific antidote. The use of gastric lavage and activated charcoal for large ingestions may be effective.

67,73,135,158,T3D0157,Ammonia,"Ammonia is a colourless alkaline gas and is one of the most abundant nitrogen-containing compounds in the atmosphere. It is an irritant with a characteristic pungent odor that is widely used in industry. Inasmuch as ammonia is highly soluble in water and, upon inhalation, is deposited in the upper airways, occupational exposures to ammonia have commonly been associated with sinusitis, upper airway irritation, and eye irritation. Acute exposures to high levels of ammonia have also been associated with diseases of the lower airways and interstitial lung. Small amounts of ammonia are naturally formed in nearly all tissues and organs of the vertebrate organism. Ammonia is both a neurotoxin and a metabotoxin. In fact, it is the most common endogenous neurotoxin. A neurotoxin is a compound that causes damage to neural tissue and neural cells. A metabotoxin is an endogenously produced metabolite that causes adverse health effects at chronically high levels. Ammonia is recognized to be central in the pathogenesis of a brain condition known as hepatic encephalopathy, which arises from various liver diseases and leads to a build up ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia). More than 40% of people with cirrhosis develop hepatic encephalopathy. Part of the neurotoxicity of ammonia arises from the fact that it easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and is absorbed and metabolized by the astrocytes, a population of cells in the brain that constitutes 30% of the cerebral cortex. Astrocytes use ammonia when synthesizing glutamine from glutamate. The increased levels of glutamine lead to an increase in osmotic pressure in the astrocytes, which become swollen. There is increased activity of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, and the energy supply to other brain cells is decreased. This can be thought of as an example of brain edema. The source of the ammonia leading to hepatic encephalopathy is not entirely clear. The gut produces ammonia, which is metabolized in the liver, and almost all organ systems are involved in ammonia metabolism. Colonic bacteria produce ammonia by splitting urea and other amino acids, however this does not fully explain hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. The alternative explanation is that hyperammonemia is the result of intestinal breakdown of amino acids, especially glutamine. The intestines have significant glutaminase activity, predominantly located in the enterocytes. On the other hand, intestinal tissues only have a little glutamine synthetase activity, making it a major glutamine-consuming organ. In addition to the intestine, the kidney is an important source of blood ammonia in patients with liver disease. Ammonia is also taken up by the muscle and brain in hepatic coma, and there is confirmation that ammonia is metabolized in muscle. Excessive formation of ammonia in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients has also been demonstrated, and it has been shown that some Alzheimer's disease patients exhibit elevated blood ammonia concentrations. Ammonia is the most important natural modulator of lysosomal protein processing. Indeed, there is strong evidence for the involvement of aberrant lysosomal processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in the formation of amyloid deposits. Inflammatory processes and activation of microglia are widely believed to be implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Ammonia is able to affect the characteristic functions of microglia, such as endocytosis, and cytokine production. Based on these facts, an ammonia-based hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease has been suggested (PMID: 17006913, 16167195, 15377862, 15369278). Chronically high levels of ammonia in the blood are associated with nearly twenty different inborn errors of metabolism including: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, 3-methyl-crotonylglycinuria, argininemia, argininosuccinic aciduria, beta-ketothiolase deficiency, biotinidase deficiency, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency, carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency, citrullinemia type I, hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome, hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome, isovaleric aciduria, lysinuric protein intolerance, malonic aciduria, methylmalonic aciduria, methylmalonic aciduria due to cobalamin-related disorders, propionic acidemia, pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, and short chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCAD deficiency). Many of these inborn errors of metabolism are associated with urea cycle disorders or impairment to amino acid metabolism. High levels of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia) lead to the activation of NMDA receptors in the brain. This results in the depletion of brain ATP, which in turn leads to release of glutamate. Ammonia also leads to the impairment of mitochondrial function and calcium homeostasis, thereby decreasing ATP synthesis. Excess ammonia also increases the formation of nitric oxide (NO), which in turn reduces the activity of glutamine synthetase, and thereby decreases the elimination of ammonia in the brain (PMID: 12020609). As a neurotoxin, ammonia predominantly affects astrocytes. Disturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, factors implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, appear to be involved in the mechanism of ammonia neurotoxicity. Ammonia can also affect the glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, the two prevailing neuronal systems of the cortical structures. All of these effects can lead to irreversible brain damage, coma, and/or death. Infants with urea cycle disorders and hyperammonemia initially exhibit vomiting and increasing lethargy. If untreated, seizures, hypotonia (poor muscle tone, floppiness), respiratory distress (respiratory alkalosis), and coma can occur. Adults with urea cycle disorders and hyperammonemia will exhibit episodes of disorientation, confusion, slurred speech, unusual and extreme combativeness or agitation, stroke-like symptoms, lethargy, and delirium. Ammonia also has toxic effects when an individual is exposed to ammonia solutions. Acute exposure to high levels of ammonia in air may be irritating to skin, eyes, throat, and lungs and cause coughing and burns. Lung damage and death may occur after exposure to very high concentrations of ammonia. Swallowing concentrated solutions of ammonia can cause burns in the mouth, throat, and stomach. Splashing ammonia into eyes can cause burns and even blindness.",7664-41-7,222.0,H3N,17.02655,Colorless gas.,-77.7°C,,"482 mg/mL at 24°C [DEAN,JA (1985)]",Oral (L958) ; inhalation (L958) ;  dermal (L958),"The topical damage caused by ammonia is probably due mainly to its alkaline properties. Its high water solubility allows it to dissolve in moisture on the mucous membranes, skin, and eyes, forming ammonium hydroxide. Ammonium hydroxide causes saponification of cell membrane lipids, resulting in cell disruption and death. Additionally, it extracts water from the cells and initiates an inflammatory response, which further damages the surrounding tissues. Excess circulating levels of ammonia (hyperammonemia) can cause serious neurological effects. This is thought to involve the alteration of glutamate metabolism in the brain and resultant increased activation of NMDA receptors, which causes decreased protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of Na+/K+ ATPase, increased activity of Na+/K+ ATPase, and depletion of ATP. Ammonia can chemically interact with an internal thiolester bond of
complement 3 (C3). This causes a conformation change in C3, which activates the alternative complement pathway, causing the release of chemoattractants and the assembly of the membrane attack complex of complement. The altered C3 can also bind directly to phagocyte complement receptors, which causes the release of toxic oxygen species. (L958)","Ammonia can be absorbed by inhalation and oral routes exposure, and also to a much lesser extent through the skin and eyes. Most of the inhaled ammonia is retained in the upper respiratory tract and is subsequently eliminated in expired air, while ingested ammonia is readily absorbed in the intestinal tract. Ammonia that reaches the circulation is widely distributed to all body compartments although substantial first pass metabolism occurs in the liver where it is transformed into urea and glutamine. Ammonia or ammonium ion reaching the tissues is taken up by glutamic acid, which participates in transamination and other reactions. Ammonia is mainly excreted in the urine.

Symptoms include cough, chest pain (severe), chest tightness, difficulty breathing and wheezing, tearing and burning of eyes, temporary blindness, throat pain (severe), mouth pain, lip swelling, heart and blood, rapid, weak pulse, collapse and shock.
Chronic exposure: Symptoms of hyperammonia include: lethargy, irritability, poor feeding, vomiting and seizures. Signs and symptoms of late-onset hyperammonemia (later in life) may include intermittent ataxia, intellectual impairment, failure to thrive, gait abnormality, behavior disturbances, epilepsy, recurrent Reye syndrome and protein avoidance.","Acute Exposure: EYES: irrigate opened eyes for several minutes under running water. INGESTION: do not induce vomiting. Rinse mouth with water (never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person). Seek immediate medical advice. SKIN: should be treated immediately by rinsing the affected parts in cold running water for at least 15 minutes, followed by thorough washing with soap and water. If necessary, the person should shower and change contaminated clothing and shoes, and then must seek medical attention. INHALATION: supply fresh air. If required provide artificial respiration.

Many PAH's induce the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1, by binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor or glycine N-methyltransferase protein. These enzymes metabolize PAH's into their toxic intermediates. The reactive metabolites of PAHs (epoxide intermediates, dihydrodiols, phenols, quinones, and their various combinations) covalently bind to DNA and other cellular macromolecules, initiating mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. (L10, L23, A27, A32)","PAH metabolism occurs in all tissues, usually by cytochrome P-450 and its associated enzymes. PAHs are metabolized into reactive intermediates, which include epoxide intermediates, dihydrodiols, phenols, quinones, and their various combinations. The phenols, quinones, and dihydrodiols can all be conjugated to glucuronides and sulfate esters; the quinones also form glutathione conjugates.

It had been reported that 1,1-dichloroethane binds to nucleic acids and proteins in vivo and in vitro. This binding is also mediated by the liver cytochrome-P-450 system.

(L403)","After absorption, 1,1-dichloroethane is distributed to the liver, kidney, lung, and stomach. In general, the identification of specific metabolites and the monitoring of enzyme activities indicate that the biotransformation of 1,1-dichloroethane is mediated by hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 system. Metabolism of 1,1-dichloroethane by hepatic microsomes results in the production of acetic acid as the major metabolite and 2,2-dichloroethanol, mono-, and dichloroacetic acid as minor metabolites. The initial steps in the metabolism of 1,1-dichloroethane were proposed to involve cytochrome P-450-dependent hydroxylations at either carbon. Hydroxylation at C-l would result in the production of an unstable alpha-haloalcohol, which can lose HCl to yield acetyl chloride. An alternative, but less favorable reaction, would be a chlorine shift to yield chloroacetyl chloride. These acyl chlorides can react with water to generate free acids or react with cellular constituents. Hydroxylation at C-2 would produce 2,2-dichloroethanol, which would undergo subsequent oxidation to dichloroacetaldehyde and dichloroacetic acid. 1,1-dichloroethane metabolites are excreted in urine and breathed out air.

71,77,142,166,T3D0165,Hexachlorocyclopentadiene,"Hexachlorocyclopentadiene (HCCPD) is a light, lemon-yellow liquid that has a sharp, musty odor. It easily turns from a liquid to a vapor when exposed to air. The vapor looks like a blue haze. HCCPD is a manufactured chemical and does not occur naturally in the environment. It is made by adding chlorine to cyclopentadiene, or by removing chlorine from octachlorocyclopentane. HCCPD is used to make a group of related pesticides (aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin, endosulfan, endrin, heptachlor, isodrin, mirex, and pentac) referred to cyclodienes. Only two of these pesticides, endosulfan and pentac, are currently registered for use in the United States.

It can be postulated, that some of its toxic properties are a consequence of its reactivity in Diels-Alder reactions where a conjugated diene combines with a substituted or unsubstituted alkene (a dienophile) in a cycloaddition reaction. Biological tissues contain a large number of potential reactants for cycloaddition reactions. HCCPD can also undergo addition and substitution reactions or be oxidized by way of the mixed function oxidase system. Effects of HCCPD on the brain may also be a reflection of the reaction of either HCCPD or a metabolite with brain lipids. The effects of HCCPD on the adrenal glands may be a reflection of its ability to combine with the unsaturated carbons in sterols produced by this gland. The hydroxyl functional group of a sterol is on a carbon adjacent to the double bond and can activate that bond to cycloaddition reactions. Such reactions would require exposure to large doses of HCCPD so that reactive material would reach the adrenal gland. HCCPD is excreted in urine and feces.

Bleeding, swelling, and fluid buildup can occur in the lungs. The linings of the respiratory passages and the lungs are very susceptible to damage from low concentrations of HCCPD following inhalation exposure. Inflammation of the tissues can be followed by necrosis, exfoliation, and hemorrhage. Tissue repair is often fibrous in appearance. Long-term exposure to very low levels of HCCPD can produce granular yellow-brown pigmentation of the epithelium of the nose, trachea, larynx, and lungs. High acute oral doses of HCCPD are associated with liver necrosis and tissue degeneration. The kidneys also appear to be a target tissue for HCCPD toxicity. Degenerative lesions in the tubules can result from small oral doses. (L437)","Inhalation of HCCPD can cause cough, sore throat, headache, diarrhoea, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and laboured breathing. Ingestion of HCCPD can cause abdominal pain,burning sensation, shock or collapse. Dermal exposure can cause redness, pain and skin burns. Eye exposure can cause redness, pain, blurred vision, and severe deep burns. (L442)","After oral exposure of HCCPD, gastric lavage is recommended. Following inhalation, move patient to fresh air.

73,79,146,171,T3D0170,p-Cresol,"p-Cresol (4-methylphenol), a 108.1 Da volatile low-molecular-weight compound, is a phenol. It is a partially lipophilic moiety which strongly binds to plasma protein (close to 100%) under normal conditions. p-Cresol is metabolized through conjugation, mainly sulphation and glucuronization, but removal of the unconjugated p-cresol is, at least in part, via the urine. Therefore it is not surprising that this compound, together with several other phenoles, is retained when the kidneys fail. P-Cresol is an end-product of protein breakdown, and an increase of the nutritional protein load in healthy individuals results in enhanced generation and urinary excretion. The serum p-cresol concentration in uremic patients can be decreased by changing to a low-protein diet. p-Cresol is one of the metabolites of the amino acid tyrosine, and to a certain extent also of phenylalanine, which are converted to 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid by intestinal bacteria, before being decarboxylated to p-cresol (putrefaction). The main contributing bacteria are aerobes (mainly enterobacteria), but to a certain extent also anaerobes play a role (mainly Clostridium perfringens). In uremia, modifications in the intestinal flora result in the specific overgrowth of bacteria that are specific p-cresol producers. The administration of antibiotics reduces urinary excretion of p-cresol, as a result of the liquidation of the producing bacteria. Environmental factors might also contribute. The liver cytochrome P450 metabolizes toluene to benzyl alcohol, but also to o-cresol and p-cresol. Toluene is not only used industrially, but it is also the most widely abusively inhaled solvent. Furthermore, p-cresol is a metabolite of menthofuran, one of the metabolites of R-(+)-pulegone, which is found in extracts from the plants Mentha pulegium and Hedeoma pulegioides, commonly known as pennyroyal oil and pennyroyal tea. These extracts are popular as unconventional herbal therapeutic agents and are applied as abortiva, diaphoretics, emmenagogues, and psychedelic drugs. Pennyroyal oil is extensively used for its pleasant mint-like smell in the flavoring industry. The toxicity of pennyroyal oil and menthofuran is well known. Another compound used in traditional medicine, especially in Japan, which is a precursor of p-cresol is wood tar creosote. p-Cresol has been reported to affect several biochemical, biological and physiological functions: (i) it diminishes the oxygen uptake of rat cerebral cortex slices; (ii) it increases the free active drug concentration of warfarin and diazepam; (iii) it has been related to growth retardation in the weanling pig; (iv) it alters cell membrane permeability, at least in bacteria; (v) it induces LDH leakage from rat liver slices; (vi) it induces susceptibility to auditive epileptic crises; and (vii) it blocks cell K+ channels. (A7723). p-Cresol is a uremic toxin that is at least partially removed by peritoneal dialysis in haemodialysis patients, and has been involved in the progression of renal failure. (MID: 11169029). At concentrations encountered during uremia, p-cresol inhibits phagocyte function and decreases leukocyte adhesion to cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells. (A3274).",106-44-5,2879.0,C7H8O,108.05751,Colorless solids or liquids. ,35.5°C,,21.5 mg/mL at 25°C,Inhalation (L528) ; dermal (L528) ; oral (L528),"p-Cresol is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Cresols can be absorbed following inhalation, oral, and dermal exposure. Once in the body they can distribute rapidly into many organs and tissues. Cresols undergo oxidative metabolism in the liver and are rapidly eliminated, mostly in the urine, as sulfate or glucuronide conjugates. The activation of cresols by oxidation involves tyrosinase and thyroid peroxidase, forming a reactive quinone methide. Experiments with recombinant P-450s demonstrated cresol metabolism was mediated by several P-450s including CYP2D6, 2C19, 1A2, 1A1, and 2E1.

They may be formed normally in the body from other compounds. Cresols are found in many foods and in wood and tobacco smoke, crude oil, coal tar, and in chemical mixtures used as wood preservatives. Small organisms in soil and water produce cresols when they break down materials in the environment. Breathing air containing cresols is the primary source of exposure. Exposure may also result from drinking contaminated water, eating contaminated food and coming into contact with liquids containing cresols. (L528)  ","Intermediate Oral: 0.1 mg/kg/day (L134) 
Chronic Oral: 0.1 mg/kg/day (L134)","Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Ingestion of p-cresol results in burning of the mouth and throat, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Inhalation or dermal exposure of animals to p-cresol can produce irritation and corrosion at the site of contact. (L482)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-03-06 18:58:12+00:00,2014-12-24 20:21:15+00:00,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p-Cresol,,C01468,,17847.0,CPD-108,C032538,"Cresol, para-",DB01688,PCR,1807.0,True,CC1=CC=C(O)C=C1,C7H8O,"InChI=1S/C7H8O/c1-6-2-4-7(8)5-3-6/h2-5,8H,1H3",InChIKey=IWDCLRJOBJJRNH-UHFFFAOYSA-N,108.1378,108.057514878,Endogenous,Solid,1.94,HMDB01858,CHEMBL16645,13839082.0,,"<p>Heliodoro Monroy, &#8220;Process of recovering <span class=""caps"">BHT</span> values from mother liquors of the crystallization of <span class=""caps"">BHT</span> obtained by alkylating p-cresol with isobutylene.&#8221; U.S. Patent US3940451, issued January, 1956.</p>",,"1-Hydroxy-4-methylbenzene

The initial step in the metabolism of 1,2-DCB is metabolism by cytochrome P-450 isozymes, mainly P4502E1, to an active epoxide. This epoxide can either react directly with cellular components, be conjugated to glutathione or glucuronic acid, or be hydrolyzed to form 2,3-dichlorophenol or 3,4-dichlorophenol. The dichlorophenol metabolites can be further metabolized by conjugation with glutathione, glucuronic acid, or sulfate, or further oxidized to catechols. An additional oxidation to form dichlorohydroquinone metabolites has also been proposed. Microsomal studies have implicated cytochrome P-450, and particularly P4502E1, as a major component of 1,2-DCB metabolism, resulting in the formation of dichlorophenols, dichlorocatechols, and dichlorohydroquinones. 1,2-DCB is eliminated primarily in the urine as metabolites rather than as the parent compound.

76,85,180,223,T3D0222,"2,4,5-Trichlorophenol","2,4,5-Trichlorophenol is a chlorinated phenol that has been used as a fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, antiseptic, defoliant, and glue preservative. The chemical 2,4,5-trichlorophenol serves as a raw material for making the herbicides Silvex and 2,4,5-T (2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid) (L159).",95-95-4,7271.0,C6H3Cl3O,195.92495,White powder.,69°C,,"1.2 mg/mL at 25 °C [LEUENBERGER,C et al. (1985A)]",Oral (L159) ; inhalation (L159) ; dermal (L159) ; eye (L159),"2,4,5-Trichlorophenol is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","2,4,5-TCP can be metabolized to 3,4,6-trichlorocatechol, 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone, and a dihydroxydichlorobenzene. Metabolites can also be dimerized to a dihydroxyhexachlorobiphenyl, a dihydroxypentachlorodiphenyl ether, two hydroxypentachlorodiphenyl ethers, a hydoxyhexachlorodiphenyl ether, and a hydroxyhexachlorodioxin or hydroxyhexachlorodiphenoquinone. The metabolites are excreted in urine (L159).","LD50: 820 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L725)",,"2B, possibly carcinogenic to humans. (L135)","Exposure may occur from drinking water that has been disinfected with chlorine and breathing air contaminated by 2,4,5-trichlorophenol. Dermal and eye contact with the toxin are also sources of exposure (L159).",Intermediate Oral: 0.003 mg/kg/day (A234),"Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Inhalation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol may cause coughing and sore throat. Eye or skin contact causes redness and pain at the site of contact. Convulsions, diarrhoea, dizziness, headache, shortness of breath, vomiting, weakness, and ataxia may occur after ingestion (L159). ","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-03-06 18:58:19+00:00,2014-12-24 20:21:21+00:00,,,C07101,,28520.0,CPD-10489,C009534,"2,4,5-Trichlorophenol",,,6559.0,True,OC1=CC(Cl)=C(Cl)C=C1Cl,C6H3Cl3O,"InChI=1S/C6H3Cl3O/c7-3-1-5(9)6(10)2-4(3)8/h1-2,10H",InChIKey=LHJGJYXLEPZJPM-UHFFFAOYSA-N,197.446,195.924947839,Exogenous,Solid,,,CHEMBL109095,7001.0,,,,"2,4, 5-Trichlorophenol

77,86,181,224,T3D0223,Arsenate,"The arsenate ion is AsO43&#8722. An arsenate (compound) is any compound that contains this ion.The arsenic atom in arsenate has a valency of 5 and is also known as pentavalent arsenic or As[V].Arsenate resembles phosphate in many respects, since arsenic and phosphorus occur in the same group (column) of the periodic table. In acidic conditions arsenate exists as arsenic acid, H3AsO4;in weakly acid conditions it exists as dihydrogen arsenate ion, H2AsO4&#8722;; in weakly basic conditions it exists as hydrogen arsenate ion HAsO42&#8722;; and finally, in basic conditions, it exists as the arsenate ion AsO43&#8722. Arsenate can replace inorganic phosphate in the step of glycolysis that produces 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, yielding 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate instead. This molecule is unstable and quickly hydrolyzes, forming the next intermediate in the pathway, 3-phosphoglycerate. Therefore glycolysis proceeds, but the ATP molecule that would be generated from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is lost - arsenate is an uncoupler of glycolysis, explaining its toxicity.[1]. Some species of bacteria obtain their energy by oxidizing various fuels while reducing arsenates to form arsenites. The enzymes involved are known as arsenate reductases. In 2008, bacteria were discovered that employ a version of photosynthesis with arsenites as electron donors, producing arsenates (just like ordinary photosynthesis uses water as electron donor, producing molecular oxygen). The researchers conjectured that historically these photosynthesizing organisms produced the arsenates that allowed the arsenate-reducing bacteria to thrive. (Wikipedia). Arsenic acid is the chemical compound with the formula H3AsO4. More descriptively written as AsO(OH)3, this colorless acid is the arsenic analogue of phosphoric acid. Arsenate and phosphate salts behave very similarly. Arsenic acid as such has not been isolated, but only found in solution where it is largely ionized. Its hemihydrate form (H3AsO4_а__H2O) does form stable crystals.

(1990)]",Oral (L2) ;  inhalation (L2) ; dermal (L2),"Arsenic and its metabolites disrupt ATP production through several mechanisms. At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase. By competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Arsenic's carginogenicity is influenced by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. The binding of other arsenic protein targets may also cause altered DNA repair enzyme activity, altered DNA methylation patterns and cell proliferation. (T1, A17)","Arsenic is mainly absorbed by inhalation or ingestion, and to a lesser extent by dermal exposure. It is then distributed throughout the body, where it is reduced into arsenite, then methylated into monomethylarsenic (MMA) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) by arsenite methyltransferase. Arsenic and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Arsenic is known to induce the metal-binding protein metallothionein, which decreases the toxic effects of arsenic and other metals by binding them and making them biologically inactive, as well as acting as an antioxidant.

78,87,183,226,T3D0225,Phorate,"Phorate is an organophosphate insecticide and acaricide that controls pests by systemic, contact, and fumigant action. It is used against sucking and chewing insects, leafhoppers, leafminers, mites, some nematodes and rootworms. Phorate is used in pine forests and on root and field crops, including corn, cotton, coffee, some ornamental and herbaceous plants and bulbs. Phorate is extremely toxic; it is a Restricted Use Pesticide (RUP) and is among the most poisonous chemicals commonly used for pest control. (L1186)",298-02-2,4790.0,C7H17O2PS3,260.01283,Phorate is a clear pale-yellow liquid with a skunk-like odor. (L1186),-43.7°C,"188 °C at 2 torr

(L1186),"Phorate is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Metabolism of organophosphates occurs principally by oxidation, by hydrolysis via esterases and by reaction with glutathione. Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.","LD50: 1.0 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L1186)

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Symptoms of acute oral exposure may include blurred vision, headache, inability to concentrate, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, irregular heart and respiration rates, tremors, excessive sweating, confusion and convulsions. Death can occur at high doses due to respiratory arrest or lung constriction. Symptoms resulting from phorate inhalation or skin contact may occur from a few minutes up to 12 hours after exposure. Workers chronically exposed to organophosphates have shown slow thinking, memory defects, irritability, delayed reaction time, and anxiety. Symptoms included a lowering of the heart rate. (L1186)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

80,90,192,241,T3D0240,Dichlorvos,"Dichlorvos is used as a household and public health fumigant, for crop protection and as an anthelmintic in animal feeds.Dichlorvos or 2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate (DDVP) is a highly volatile organophosphate, widely used as a insecticide to control household pests, in public health, and protecting stored product from insects. It is effective against mushroom flies, aphids, spider mites, caterpillars, thrips, and whiteflies in greenhouse, outdoor fruit, and vegetable crops. (Wikipedia) Dichlorvos has been shown to exhibit neurotransmitter and relaxant functions (A7732, A7733).",62-73-7,3039.0,C4H7Cl2O4P,219.9459,Colorless liquid.,-60°C,> 184°C (363°F ),8 mg/mL at 20°C,Oral (L1171) ;  inhalation (L1171) ; dermal (L1171),"Dichlorvos is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Metabolism of organophosphates occurs principally by oxidation, by hydrolysis via esterases and by reaction with glutathione. Demethylation and glucuronidation may also occur.  Oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides may result in moderately toxic products.  In general, phosphorothioates are not directly toxic but require oxidative metabolism to the proximal toxin.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.","LD50: 56 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L1170)

(L1171)",,"Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","The effects of organophosphate poisoning are recalled using the mnemonic SLUDGEM (Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Diaphoresis (or Defecation), Gastrointestinal motility, Emesis, Miosis). (L1168)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-03-06 18:58:21+00:00,2014-12-24 20:21:23+00:00,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichlorvos,,C14430,,34690.0,PANTOYL-LACTONE,D004006,Dichlorvos,,,454.0,True,COP(=O)(OC)OC=C(Cl)Cl,C4H7Cl2O4P,"InChI=1S/C4H7Cl2O4P/c1-8-11(7,9-2)10-3-4(5)6/h3H,1-2H3",InChIKey=OEBRKCOSUFCWJD-UHFFFAOYSA-N,220.976,219.945900638,Exogenous,Liquid,1.43,HMDB33956,CHEMBL167911,2931.0,,,,"2,2-Dichloroethenol dimethyl phosphate

Mercury is known to bind to microsomal and mitochondrial enzymes, resulting in cell injury and death. For example, mercury is known to inhibit aquaporins, halting water flow across the cell membrane. It also inhibits the protein LCK, which causes decreased T-cell signalling and immune system depression. Mercury is also believed to inhibit neuronal excitability by acting on the postsynaptic neuronal membrane. It also affects the nervous system by inhibiting protein kinase C and alkaline phosphatase, which impairs brain microvascular formation and function, as well as alters the blood-brain barrier.

At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and by competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Arsenic's carginogenicity is influenced by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. The binding of other arsenic protein targets may also cause altered DNA repair enzyme activity, altered DNA methylation patterns and cell proliferation. (T1, A17)","Arsenic is absorbed mainly by inhalation or ingestion, as to a lesser extent, dermal exposure. It is then distributed throughout the body, where it is reduced into arsenite if necessary, then methylated into monomethylarsenic (MMA) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) by arsenite methyltransferase. Arsenic and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Arsenic is known to induce the metal-binding protein metallothionein, which decreases the toxic effects of arsenic and other metals by binding them and making them biologically inactive, as well as acting as an antioxidant.

84,96,200,249,T3D0248,"2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid","2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is a common systemic herbicide used in the control of broadleaf weeds. It is the most widely used herbicide in the world, and the third most commonly used in North America. 2,4-D is also an important synthetic auxin, often used in laboratories for plant research and as a supplement in plant cell culture media such as MS medium. (S685). 2,4-D can be formulated as emulsifiable concentrates, granules, soluble concentrate and solids, water-dispersible granules, and wettable powders. 2,4-D is used alone, but is commonly formulated with dicamba, mecoprop, mecoprop-p, MCPA, and clopyralid. 2,4-D was one of the ingredients in Agent Orange, the herbicide widely used during the Vietnam War. Though 2,4-D composed 50% of Agent Orange, the health effects of Agent Orange are related to dioxin contaminants generated during the production of Agent Orange – not 2,4-D itself. On August 8, 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a ruling that stated that existing data do not support a link between human cancer and 2,4-D exposure.",94-75-7,1486.0,C8H6Cl2O3,219.9694,White to yellow powder.

It is also known to inhibit glutathione S transferase which leads to a depletion of ATP, NADPH and glutathione (A3122, A3123).  These actions can cause cell toxicity and apopotosis among metabolically active cells.  Some of the endocrine effects of 2,4-D may be mediated by the 2,4-D mediated displacement of sex hormones from the sex hormone binding globulin or the 2,4-D mediated blocking or OAT6 transport proteins that are needed for the transport of functional organic ions and dicarboxylates (including estrone sulfate).
","Metabolism of 2,4-D is minimal in humans, with nearly all of it excreted unchanged as the parent compound. In particular, 2,4-D is rapidly excreted from the body, primarily in the urine. Much of the compound appears to be eliminated unchanged, although some 2,4-D is eliminated from the body as a conjugate. 2,4-D is metabolized to 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4), the major form of monooxygenase enzyme in the human liver.

(L135)","2,4-D is is an agrochemical - a substance that is used in agriculture or horticulture. It is a broadleaf herbicide, which when sprayed or dusted on plants causes its leaves to fall off, and functions as a synthetic auxin. 2,4-D is commonly found in lawn care products; wheat, corn, and other grass family herbicides; forestry products; treatments for roadside weeds; and aquatic weed control products.",,"All forms of 2,4-D are considered low in toxicity when absorbed via skin or via inhalation. The acid and salt forms of 2,4-D are highly toxic to eye tissue.  Long term chronic exposure to 2,4-D has been linked to non-Hodgkins lymphoma and Parkinson’s disease but these are epidemiological associations only.  2,4-D is also reported to have negative effects on the endocrine system (specifically the thyroid and gonads) and immune system. 2,4-D displaces sex hormones from the protein (sex hormone binding globulin) that normally transports these hormones in the blood.  2,4-D reduces the activity of several proteins important to immune system function. Researchers at NIOSH have demonstrated a decreased production of cells responsible for making antibodies in mice bone marrow, in addition to decreased T-cells, produced in the thymus.","Symptoms of acute oral exposure include vomiting, diarrhea, headache, confusion, aggressive or bizarre behavior, hypotension and muscle twitching.  Skeletal muscle injury and renal failure may also occur. Prolonged dermal exposure may include skin irritation, whereas prolonged inhalation exposure may lead to coughing and burning sensations in the upper respiratory tract and chest. ","The general treatment of acute chlorophenoxy herbicide poisoning consists of decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract, resuscitation and supportive care. For severe, acute oral poisoning by 2,4-D forced alkaline diuresis appears to be most effective (A7734). Forced alkaline diuresis is often used to increase the excretion of acidic drugs like salicylates and phenobarbitone. For forced alkaline diuresis, a diuretic like furosemide is given intravenously and sodium bicarbonate is added to the infusion fluid to make blood and, in turn, urine alkaline. Potassium replacement becomes of utmost importance during the process because potassium is usually lost in urine. If blood levels of potassium are depleted below normal levels, then hypokalemia occurs, which promotes bicarbonate ion retention and prevents bicarbonate excretion, thus interfering with the alkalinization of the urine.",2009-03-06 18:58:22+00:00,2014-12-24 20:21:24+00:00,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic_acid",,C03664,,28854.0,CPD-9009,D015084,"2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid",,CFA,447.0,True,OC(=O)COC1=C(Cl)C=C(Cl)C=C1,C8H6Cl2O3,"InChI=1S/C8H6Cl2O3/c9-5-1-2-7(6(10)3-5)13-4-8(11)12/h1-3H,4H2,(H,11,12)",InChIKey=OVSKIKFHRZPJSS-UHFFFAOYSA-N,221.037,219.969399472,Exogenous,Solid,2.81,HMDB41797,CHEMBL367623,1441.0,,"Robert Pokorny New Compounds.

85,97,202,253,T3D0252,"N,N-Dimethylformamide","N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) is a clear liquid that has been widely used in industries as a solvent, an additive, or an intermediate because of its extensive miscibility with water and most common organic solvents. Its health effects include hepatotoxicity and male reproductoxicity, possibly linked with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations including mtDNA common deletion (delta-mtDNA4977) and mtDNA copy number; during the biotransformation of DMF in the body, free radicals are formed, including hydroxyl radicals. The world-wide consumption of DMF in 2001 was approximately 285,000 metric tonnes and most of that was used as an industrial solvent. Overexposure to DMF could result in hepatotoxicity, alcohol intolerance, possible embryotoxicity and teratogenicity in humans and animals, and decline of human sperm motility. Based on its wide application and a wide range of toxic effects, DMF has been selected as one of the four priority compounds for human field studies by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).

88,102,212,277,T3D0276,Arsenic trisulfide,"Arsenic sulfide is a sulfide of arsenic that occurs as the mineral orpiment. In its natural form it is considered non-toxic due to its low solubility, however in its crystalline form it tends to oxidize into arsenic trioxide. In addition, commercial orpiment often contains substantial amounts of arsenic oxides.  Arsenic is a chemical element that has the symbol As and atomic number 33. It is a poisonous metalloid that has many allotropic forms: yellow (molecular non-metallic) and several black and grey forms (metalloids) are a few that are seen. Three metalloidal forms of arsenic with different crystal structures are found free in nature (the minerals arsenopyrite and the much rarer arsenolamprite and pararsenolamprite), but it is more commonly found as a compound with other elements.

At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and by competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Arsenic's carginogenicity is influenced by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. The binding of other arsenic protein targets may also cause altered DNA repair enzyme activity, altered DNA methylation patterns and cell proliferation. (T1, A17)","Arsenic is absorbed mainly by inhalation or ingestion, as to a lesser extent, dermal exposure. It is then distributed throughout the body, where it is reduced into arsenite if necessary, then methylated into monomethylarsenic (MMA) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) by arsenite methyltransferase. Arsenic and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Arsenic is known to induce the metal-binding protein metallothionein, which decreases the toxic effects of arsenic and other metals by binding them and making them biologically inactive, as well as acting as an antioxidant.

Arsenic is absorbed mainly by inhalation or ingestion, as to a lesser extent, dermal exposure. It is then distributed throughout the body, where it is reduced into arsenite if necessary, then methylated into monomethylarsenic (MMA) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) by arsenite methyltransferase. Arsenic and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Arsenic is known to induce the metal-binding protein metallothionein, which decreases the toxic effects of arsenic and other metals by binding them and making them biologically inactive, as well as acting as an antioxidant.

Arsenic's carginogenicity is influenced by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. The binding of other arsenic protein targets may also cause altered DNA repair enzyme activity, altered DNA methylation patterns and cell proliferation. Lead mimics other biologically important metals, such as zinc, calcium, and iron, competing as cofactors for many of their respective enzymatic reactions. For example, lead has been shown to competitively inhibit calcium's binding of calmodulin, interferring with neurotransmitter release. It exhibits similar competitive inhibition at the NMDA receptor and protein kinase C, which impairs brain microvascular formation and function, as well as alters the blood-brain barrier. Lead also affects the nervous system by impairing regulation of dopamine synthesis and blocking evoked release of acetylcholine. However, it's main mechanism of action occurs by inhibiting delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, an enzyme vital in the biosynthesis of heme, which is a necesssary cofactor of hemoglobin. (T1, T4, A17, A20, A22, L136)","Lead and arsenic are absorbed following inhalation, oral, and dermal exposure. Arsenic is then distributed throughout the body, where it is reduced into arsenite if necessary, then methylated into monomethylarsenic (MMA) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) by arsenite methyltransferase. Arsenic and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Arsenic is known to induce the metal-binding protein metallothionein, which decreases the toxic effects of arsenic and other metals by binding them and making them biologically inactive, as well as acting as an antioxidant.  Lead is distributed mainly to the bones and red blood cells. In the blood lead may be found bound to serum albumin or the metal-binding protein metallothionein. Organic lead is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 enzymes, whereas inorganic lead forms complexes with delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase. Lead is excreted mainly in the urine and faeces.

Lead exposure can result in nephropathy, as well as blood disorders such as high blood pressure and anemia. Lead also exhibits reproductive toxicity and can results in miscarriages and reduced sperm production.

Encephalopathy, with headache, lethargy, mental confusion, hallucinations, emotional lability, memory loss and delirium may occur; seizures, stupor, convulsions, coma, and death may follow within 24 hours of a severe acute exposure. Dysrhythmias (particularly QTc prolongation and torsade de pointes), cardiomyopathy, ARDS, hepatitis, rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis, and renal failure may develop over several days. The sequence of chronic poisoning involves hyperpigmentation, and eczematoid and allergic dermatitis. muscle fasciculations; gross tremors; ataxia; incoordination; and mental confusion. Muscular weakness, limb tenderness and difficulty walking may follow. The final phase consists of peripheral sensory neuropathy of the hands and feet.

It is often used in the production of mercury and as a material for cathodes for mercury batteries. Mercury is a heavy, silvery d-block metal and one of six elements that are liquid at or near room temperature and pressure. It is a naturally occuring substance, and combines with other elements such as chlorine, sulfur, or oxygen to form inorganic mercury compounds (salts). Mercury also combines with carbon to make organic mercury compounds.

Through alterations in intracellular thiol status, mercury can promote oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and changes in heme metabolism. Mercury is known to bind to microsomal and mitochondrial enzymes, resulting in cell injury and death. For example, mercury is known to inhibit aquaporins, halting water flow across the cell membrane. It also inhibits the protein LCK, which causes decreased T-cell signalling and immune system depression. Mercury is also believed to inhibit neuronal excitability by acting on the postsynaptic neuronal membrane. It also affects the nervous system by inhibiting protein kinase C and alkaline phosphatase, which impairs brain microvascular formation and function, as well as alters the blood-brain barrier. Mercury also produces an autoimmune response, likely by modification of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, self peptides, T-cell receptors, or cell-surface adhesion molecules. (L7, A8, A25, A26)","Mercury is absorbed mainly via ingestion and inhalation, then distributed throughout the body via the bloodstream, where a portion binds to sulfhydryl groups on haemoglobin. Mercury can undergo oxidation to mercuric mercury, which takes place via the catalase-hydrogen peroxide pathway. The mercury atom is able to diffuse down the cleft in the catalase enzyme to reach the active site where the heme ring is located. Oxidation most likely occurs in all tissue, as the catalase hydrogen peroxide pathway is ubiquitous. Following oxidation, mercury tends to accumulate in the kidneys. Mercury is excreted mainly by exhalation and in the faeces. (A6, L7)","LD50: 18 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L428)",1 gram for an adult human (average for inorganic mercurials).

Exposure to high levels of metallic, inorganic, or organic mercury can permanently damage the brain, kidneys, and developing fetus. Effects on brain functioning may result in irritability, shyness, tremors, changes in vision or hearing, and memory problems. Acrodynia, a type of mercury poisoning in children, is characterized by pain and pink discoloration of the hands and feet. Mercury poisoning can also cause Hunter-Russell syndrome and Minamata disease.

101,119,270,344,T3D0343,Mercury(I) chloride,"Mercury(I) chloride is a chloride of mercury that occurs naturally as the mineral calomel. It is used primarily for reference electrodes in electrochemistry. Mercury is a heavy, silvery d-block metal and one of six elements that are liquid at or near room temperature and pressure. It is a naturally occuring substance, and combines with other elements such as chlorine, sulfur, or oxygen to form inorganic mercury compounds (salts). Mercury also combines with carbon to make organic mercury compounds. (L1, L429)",10112-91-1,24956.0,Cl2Hg2,473.87896,White crystals.,525°C (triple point),,"0.002 mg/mL at 18°C [SHIU,WY et al.

Through alterations in intracellular thiol status, mercury can promote oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and changes in heme metabolism. Mercury is known to bind to microsomal and mitochondrial enzymes, resulting in cell injury and death. For example, mercury is known to inhibit aquaporins, halting water flow across the cell membrane. It also inhibits the protein LCK, which causes decreased T-cell signalling and immune system depression. Mercury is also believed to inhibit neuronal excitability by acting on the postsynaptic neuronal membrane. It also affects the nervous system by inhibiting protein kinase C and alkaline phosphatase, which impairs brain microvascular formation and function, as well as alters the blood-brain barrier. Mercury also produces an autoimmune response, likely by modification of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, self peptides, T-cell receptors, or cell-surface adhesion molecules. (L7, A8, A25, A26)","Mercury is absorbed mainly via ingestion and inhalation, then distributed throughout the body via the bloodstream, where a portion binds to sulfhydryl groups on haemoglobin.

Through alterations in intracellular thiol status, mercury can promote oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and changes in heme metabolism. Mercury is known to bind to microsomal and mitochondrial enzymes, resulting in cell injury and death. For example, mercury is known to inhibit aquaporins, halting water flow across the cell membrane. It also inhibits the protein LCK, which causes decreased T-cell signalling and immune system depression. Mercury is also believed to inhibit neuronal excitability by acting on the postsynaptic neuronal membrane. It also affects the nervous system by inhibiting protein kinase C and alkaline phosphatase, which impairs brain microvascular formation and function, as well as alters the blood-brain barrier. Mercury also produces an autoimmune response, likely by modification of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, self peptides, T-cell receptors, or cell-surface adhesion molecules. (L7, A8, A25, A26)","Mercury is absorbed mainly via ingestion and inhalation, then distributed throughout the body via the bloodstream, where a portion binds to sulfhydryl groups on haemoglobin. Mercury can undergo oxidation to mercuric mercury, which takes place via the catalase-hydrogen peroxide pathway. The mercury atom is able to diffuse down the cleft in the catalase enzyme to reach the active site where the heme ring is located. Oxidation most likely occurs in all tissue, as the catalase hydrogen peroxide pathway is ubiquitous. Following oxidation, mercury tends to accumulate in the kidneys.

107,125,281,355,T3D0354,Mercury(II) nitrate,"Mercury(II) nitrate is a nitrate of mercury previously used to treat fur and make felt. Today it is used mainly in the synthesis of other mercuric compounds. Mercury is a heavy, silvery d-block metal and one of six elements that are liquid at or near room temperature and pressure. It is a naturally occuring substance, and combines with other elements such as chlorine, sulfur, or oxygen to form inorganic mercury compounds (salts). Mercury also combines with carbon to make organic mercury compounds. Nitrite is a toxic compound known to cause methemoglobinemia. (L1137,  L1, L441)",10045-94-0,115042.0,HHgNO3,264.96627,Colorless or white crystals.,,,,Oral (L7) ; inhalation (L7);  dermal (L7),"High-affinity binding of the divalent mercuric ion to thiol or sulfhydryl groups of proteins is believed to be the major mechanism for the activity of mercury. Through alterations in intracellular thiol status, mercury can promote oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and changes in heme metabolism. Mercury is known to bind to microsomal and mitochondrial enzymes, resulting in cell injury and death. For example, mercury is known to inhibit aquaporins, halting water flow across the cell membrane. It also inhibits the protein LCK, which causes decreased T-cell signalling and immune system depression. Mercury is also believed to inhibit neuronal excitability by acting on the postsynaptic neuronal membrane. It also affects the nervous system by inhibiting protein kinase C and alkaline phosphatase, which impairs brain microvascular formation and function, as well as alters the blood-brain barrier. Mercury also produces an autoimmune response, likely by modification of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, self peptides, T-cell receptors, or cell-surface adhesion molecules. Nitrate's toxicity is a result of it's conversion to nitrite once in the body. Nitrite causes the autocatalytic oxidation of oxyhemoglobin to hydrogen peroxide and methemoglobin. This elevation of methemoglobin levels is a condition known as methemoglobinemia, and is characterized by tissue hypoxia, as methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen. (A2450, L1613, L7, A8, A25, A26)","Mercury is absorbed mainly via ingestion and inhalation, then distributed throughout the body via the bloodstream, where a portion binds to sulfhydryl groups on haemoglobin. Mercury can undergo oxidation to mercuric mercury, which takes place via the catalase-hydrogen peroxide pathway. The mercury atom is able to diffuse down the cleft in the catalase enzyme to reach the active site where the heme ring is located. Oxidation most likely occurs in all tissue, as the catalase hydrogen peroxide pathway is ubiquitous. Following oxidation, mercury tends to accumulate in the kidneys. Mercury is excreted mainly by exhalation and in the faeces. Intake of some amount of nitrates and nitrites is a normal part of the nitrogen cycle in humans. In vivo conversion of nitrates to nitrites can occur in the gastrointestional tract under the right conditions, significantly enhancing nitrates' toxic potency. The major metabolic pathway for nitrate is conversion to nitrite, and then to ammonia. Nitrites, nitrates, and their metabolites are excreted in the urine.

(L441),Chronic Inhalation: 0.0002 mg/m3 (L134),"Mercury mainly affects the nervous system. Exposure to high levels of metallic, inorganic, or organic mercury can permanently damage the brain, kidneys, and developing fetus. Effects on brain functioning may result in irritability, shyness, tremors, changes in vision or hearing, and memory problems. Acrodynia, a type of mercury poisoning in children, is characterized by pain and pink discoloration of the hands and feet. Mercury poisoning can also cause Hunter-Russell syndrome and Minamata disease. Nitrate and nitrite poisoning causes methemoglobinemia. Nitrites may cause pregnancy complications and developmental effects. They may also be carcinogenic. (L1137, L7)","Common symptoms include peripheral neuropathy (presenting as paresthesia or itching, burning or pain), skin discoloration (pink cheeks, fingertips and toes), edema (swelling), and desquamation (dead skin peels off in layers). Nitrate and nitrite poisoning causes methemoglobinemia. Symptoms include cyanosis, cardiac dysrhythmias and circulatory failure, and progressive central nervous system (CNS) effects. CNS effects can range from mild dizziness and lethargy to coma and convulsions. (L1137, A5)","Mercury poisoning is treated by immediate decontamination and chelation therapy using DMSA, DMPS, DPCN, or dimercaprol. Methemoglobinemia can be treated with supplemental oxygen and methylene blue 1% solution administered intravenously slowly over five minutes followed by IV flush with normal saline.

Mercury also produces an autoimmune response, likely by modification of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, self peptides, T-cell receptors, or cell-surface adhesion molecules. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase.

115,136,302,379,T3D0378,Cadmium nitrate,"Cadmium nitrate is a nitrate of cadmium used mainly to prepare other cadmium salts. It is also used for coloring glass and porcelain and as a flash powder in photography. Cadmium is a transition metal and chemical element with the symbol Cd and atomic number 48. It is found naturally in the earth's crust, though rarely on it's own. Nitrite is a toxic compound known to cause methemoglobinemia.

Toxic effects are observed once the concentration of cadmium exceeds that of available metallothionein, and it has also been shown that the cadmium-metallothionein complex may be damaging. Accumulation of cadmium in the kidney results in increased excretion of vital low and high weight molecular proteins. Cadmium is a high affinity zinc analog and can interfere in its biological processes. It also binds to and activates the estrogen receptor, likely stimulating the growth of certain types of cancer cells and causing other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. Cadmium causes cell apoptosis by activating mitogen-activated protein kinases. Nitrate's toxicity is a result of it's conversion to nitrite once in the body. Nitrite causes the autocatalytic oxidation of oxyhemoglobin to hydrogen peroxide and methemoglobin. This elevation of methemoglobin levels is a condition known as methemoglobinemia, and is characterized by tissue hypoxia, as methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen. (A2450, L1613, L8, A18, A19, A28)","Cadmium is absorbed from oral, inhalation, and dermal routes. Cadmium initially binds to metallothionein and albumin and is transported mainly to the kidney and liver. Toxic effects are observed once the concentration of cadmium exceeds that of available metallothionein, and it has also been shown that the cadmium-metallothionein complex may be damaging. Cadmium is not known to undergo any direct metabolic conversion and is excreted unchanged, mainly in the urine. Intake of some amount of nitrates and nitrites is a normal part of the nitrogen cycle in humans. In vivo conversion of nitrates to nitrites can occur in the gastrointestional tract under the right conditions, significantly enhancing nitrates' toxic potency. The major metabolic pathway for nitrate is conversion to nitrite, and then to ammonia. Nitrites, nitrates, and their metabolites are excreted in the urine.

120,142,312,391,T3D0390,2-Chlorobiphenyl,"2-Chlorobiphenyl is one of 209 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). PCBs are a group of synthetic organic compounds with 1-10 chlorine atoms attached to biphenyl. They were manufactured as commercial mixtures but banned in the 1970's because they were found to bioaccumulate and cause harmful health effects. However, PCBs do not break down readily and are still found in the environment. (L4)

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are transported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose tissue, and skin. Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The major metabolites are hydroxylated products which are excreted in the bile and faeces. The slow metabolism of PCBs means they tend to accumulate in body tissues.

121,143,313,392,T3D0391,3-Chlorobiphenyl,"3-Chlorobiphenyl is one of 209 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). PCBs are a group of synthetic organic compounds with 1-10 chlorine atoms attached to biphenyl. They were manufactured as commercial mixtures but banned in the 1970's because they were found to bioaccumulate and cause harmful health effects. However, PCBs do not break down readily and are still found in the environment. (L4)

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are trasported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin. Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The major metabolites are hydroxylated products which are excreted in the bile and faeces. The slow metabolism of PCBs means they tend to accumulate in body tissues.

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are trasported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin. Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The major metabolites are hydroxylated products which are excreted in the bile and faeces. The slow metabolism of PCBs means they tend to accumulate in body tissues.

PCBs are a group of synthetic organic compounds with 1-10 chlorine atoms attached to biphenyl.

However, PCBs do not break down readily and are still found in the environment. (L4)

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are trasported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin. Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The major metabolites are hydroxylated products which are excreted in the bile and faeces. The slow metabolism of PCBs means they tend to accumulate in body tissues.

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are trasported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are trasported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin. Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure.

Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are trasported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin. Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The major metabolites are hydroxylated products which are excreted in the bile and faeces. The slow metabolism of PCBs means they tend to accumulate in body tissues.

PCBs are a group of synthetic organic compounds with 1-10 chlorine atoms attached to biphenyl.

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are trasported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin. Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The major metabolites are hydroxylated products which are excreted in the bile and faeces. The slow metabolism of PCBs means they tend to accumulate in body tissues.

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are trasported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin. Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The major metabolites are hydroxylated products which are excreted in the bile and faeces. The slow metabolism of PCBs means they tend to accumulate in body tissues.

Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are trasported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are trasported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The major metabolites are hydroxylated products which are excreted in the bile and faeces. The slow metabolism of PCBs means they tend to accumulate in body tissues.

PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure.

Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are trasported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

Dioxin-like PCBs bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which disrupts cell function by altering the transcription of genes, mainly be inducing the expression of hepatic Phase I and Phase II enzymes, especially of the cytochrome P450 family. Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

Most of the toxic effects of PCBs are believed to be results of Ah receptor binding. Other PBCs are believed to interfere with calcium channels and/or change brain dopamine levels. PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction. They will bioaccumulate by binding to receptor proteins such as uteroglobin. (A3, A4, A30, A66)","PCBs are absorbed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes of exposure. They are trasported in the blood, often bound to albumin. Due to their lipophilic nature they tend to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver, adipose, and skin. Metabolism of PCBs is very slow and varies based on the degree and position of chlorination. PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The major metabolites are hydroxylated products which are excreted in the bile and faeces. The slow metabolism of PCBs means they tend to accumulate in body tissues.

PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

PCBs can also cause endocrine disurption by altering the production of thyroid hormones and binding to estrogen receptors, which can stimulate the growth of certain cancer cells and produce other estrogenic effects, such as reproductive dysfunction.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

PCBs are metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid.

DDT reduces potassium transport across the membrane. DDT alters the porous channels through which sodium ions pass. These channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization. DDT inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. DDT also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron.

Also present in cocoa, black tea and scotch whiskey. Quinoline is a flavouring ingredient Quinoline is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound. It has the formula C9H7N and is a colourless hygroscopic liquid with a strong odour. Aged samples, if exposed to light, become yellow and later brown. Quinoline is only slightly soluble in cold water but dissolves readily in hot water and most organic solvents. Quinoline is mainly used as a building block to other specialty chemicals. Approximately 4 tonnes are produced annually according to a report published in 2005.[citation needed] Its principal use is as a precursor to 8-hydroxyquinoline, which is a versatile chelating agent and precursor to pesticides. Its 2- and 4-methyl derivatives are precursors to cyanine dyes. Oxidation of quinoline affords quinolinic acid (pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid), a precursor to the herbicide sold under the name Assert.

Quinoline has been shown to exhibit catabolic, anti-microbial, anti-tumor, anti-fungal and anti-cancer functions (A7755, A7756, A7757, A7759, A7760).",91-22-5,7047.0,C9H7N,129.05785,Colorless solid.,-15.6°C,238°C (460.4°F),6.11 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L10) ; inhalation (L10),"The ability of PAH's to bind to blood proteins such as albumin allows them to be transported throughout the body.

Cobalt may activate specific helper T-lymphocyte cells and interact directly with immunologic proteins, such as antibodies (IgA and IgE) or Fc receptors, resulting in immunosensitization. (L29) Nitrate's toxicity is a result of it's conversion to nitrite once in the body. Nitrite causes the autocatalytic oxidation of oxyhemoglobin to hydrogen peroxide and methemoglobin. This elevation of methemoglobin levels is a condition known as methemoglobinemia, and is characterized by tissue hypoxia, as methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen. (A2450, L1613)","Cobalt is absorbed though the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. Since it is a component of the vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), it is distributed to most tissues of the body.

Intake of some amount of nitrates and nitrites is a normal part of the nitrogen cycle in humans. In vivo conversion of nitrates to nitrites can occur in the gastrointestional tract under the right conditions, significantly enhancing nitrates' toxic potency. The major metabolic pathway for nitrate is conversion to nitrite, and then to ammonia. Nitrites, nitrates, and their metabolites are excreted in the urine.

338,363,561,667,T3D0666,Cobalt(II) oxide,"Cobalt(II) oxide is an oxide of cobalt. It is used in the production of glazes and enamels for ceramics. Cobalt is a metallic element with the atomic number 27. It is found naturally in rocks, soil, water, plants, and animals. In small amounts cobalt is an essential element for life, as it is part of vitamin B12. However, excess exposure is known to exhibit toxic effects.

It produces oxygen radicals and may be oxidized to ionic cobalt, causing increased lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and inducing certain enzymes that lead to cell apoptosis. Cobalt has also been shown to block inorganic calcium channels, possibly impairing neurotransmission. Cobalt can also chelate lipoic acids, impairing oxidation of pyruvate or fatty acids. In addition, cobalt may inhibit DNA repair by interacting with zinc finger DNA repair proteins, and has also been shown to inhibit heme synthesis and glucose metabolism. Cobalt may activate specific helper T-lymphocyte cells and interact directly with immunologic proteins, such as antibodies (IgA and IgE) or Fc receptors, resulting in immunosensitization.

340,365,579,685,T3D0684,Nickel acetate,"Nickel acetate is a chemical compound of nickel. Nickel is a chemical compound with the atomic number 28. It is found abundantly in nature in laterite ore minerals, such as limonite, garnierite, and pentlandite. Nickel has a biological role and is found in certain enzymes, including urease, hydrogenase, methylcoenzyme M reductase, and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. (L40, L41)",373-02-4,9756.0,C4H14NiO8,60.02113,Green solid.,16.6°C,,166 mg/mL [MERCK INDEX (1996)],Inhalation  (L41) ; oral (L41) ; dermal (L41),"Nickel is known to substitute for other essential elements in certain enzmes, such as calcineurin. It is genotoxic, and some nickel compounds have been shown to promote cell proliferation. Nickel has a high affinity for chromatin proteins, particularly histones and protamines. The complexing of nickel ions with heterochromatin results in a number of alterations including condensation, DNA hypermethylation, gene silencing, and inhibition of histone acetylation, which have been shown to disturb gene expression. Nickel has also been shown to alter several transcription factors, including hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, activating transcription factor, and NF-KB transcription factor. There is also evidence that nickel ions inhibit DNA repair, either by directly inhibiting DNA repair enzymes or competing with zinc ions for binding to zinc-finger DNA binding proteins, resulting in structural changes in DNA that prevent repair enzymes from binding. Nickel ions can also complex with a number of cellular ligands including amino acids, peptides, and proteins resulting in the generation of oxygen radicals, which induce base damage, DNA strand breaks, and DNA protein crosslinks. (L41, A40)","Nickel is absorbed mainly through the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Once in the body it enters the bloodstream, where it binds to albumin, L-histidine, and _2-macroglobulin. Nickel tends to accumulate in the lungs, thyroid, kidney, heart, and liver. Absorbed nickel is excreted in the urine, wherease unabsorbed nickel is excreted in the faeces. (L41)","LD50: 350 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L503)",,"1, carcinogenic to humans. (L135)",,"Chronic Inhalation: 0.0001 mg/m3 (L134) 

Intermediate Oral: 0.01 mg/kg/day (L134) ","The most common harmful health effect of nickel in humans is an allergic reaction. This usually manifests as a skin rash, although some people experience asthma attacks. Long term inhahation of nickel causes chronic bronchitis and reduced lung function, as well as damage to the naval cavity. Ingestion of excess nickel results in damage to the stomach, blood, liver, kidneys, and immune system, as well as having adverse effects on reproduction and development. (L41)","Symptoms of nickel poisoning include headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, irritability, and difficulty sleeping, followed by chest pains, sweating, rapid heart beat, and a dry cough. (L42)",Excess exposure to nickel is usually handled by preventing further exposure and symptomatic treatment. Nickel poisoning may also be treated using chelation therapy with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. (L42),2009-03-23 00:28:30+00:00,2014-12-24 20:22:33+00:00,,,,"276100

Nickel ions can also complex with a number of cellular ligands including amino acids, peptides, and proteins resulting in the generation of oxygen radicals, which induce base damage, DNA strand breaks, and DNA protein crosslinks. Nitrate's toxicity is a result of it's conversion to nitrite once in the body. Nitrite causes the autocatalytic oxidation of oxyhemoglobin to hydrogen peroxide and methemoglobin. This elevation of methemoglobin levels is a condition known as methemoglobinemia, and is characterized by tissue hypoxia, as methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen.

In vivo conversion of nitrates to nitrites can occur in the gastrointestional tract under the right conditions, significantly enhancing nitrates' toxic potency.

343,368,592,698,T3D0697,Nickel sulfate,"Nickel sulfate is a sulfate of nickel. It is commonly used for electroplating. Nickel is a chemical compound with the atomic number 28. It is found abundantly in nature in laterite ore minerals, such as limonite, garnierite, and pentlandite. Nickel has a biological role and is found in certain enzymes, including urease, hydrogenase, methylcoenzyme M reductase, and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase.

It is genotoxic, and some nickel compounds have been shown to promote cell proliferation. Nickel has a high affinity for chromatin proteins, particularly histones and protamines. The complexing of nickel ions with heterochromatin results in a number of alterations including condensation, DNA hypermethylation, gene silencing, and inhibition of histone acetylation, which have been shown to disturb gene expression. Nickel has also been shown to alter several transcription factors, including hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, activating transcription factor, and NF-KB transcription factor. There is also evidence that nickel ions inhibit DNA repair, either by directly inhibiting DNA repair enzymes or competing with zinc ions for binding to zinc-finger DNA binding proteins, resulting in structural changes in DNA that prevent repair enzymes from binding. Nickel ions can also complex with a number of cellular ligands including amino acids, peptides, and proteins resulting in the generation of oxygen radicals, which induce base damage, DNA strand breaks, and DNA protein crosslinks. (L41, A40)","Nickel is absorbed mainly through the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Once in the body it enters the bloodstream, where it binds to albumin, L-histidine, and _2-macroglobulin. Nickel tends to accumulate in the lungs, thyroid, kidney, heart, and liver. Absorbed nickel is excreted in the urine, wherease unabsorbed nickel is excreted in the faeces.

This usually manifests as a skin rash, although some people experience asthma attacks. Long term inhahation of nickel causes chronic bronchitis and reduced lung function, as well as damage to the naval cavity. Ingestion of excess nickel results in damage to the stomach, blood, liver, kidneys, and immune system, as well as having adverse effects on reproduction and development. (L41)","Symptoms of nickel poisoning include headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, irritability, and difficulty sleeping, followed by chest pains, sweating, rapid heart beat, and a dry cough.

Trivalent chromium may also form complexes with peptides, proteins, and DNA, resulting in DNA-protein crosslinks, DNA strand breaks, DNA-DNA interstrand crosslinks, chromium-DNA adducts, chromosomal aberrations and alterations in cellular signaling pathways. It has been shown to induce carcinogenesis by overstimulating cellular regulatory pathways and increasing peroxide levels by activating certain mitogen-activated protein kinases. It can also cause transcriptional repression by cross-linking histone deacetylase 1-DNA methyltransferase 1 complexes to CYP1A1 promoter chromatin, inhibiting histone modification. Chromium may increase its own toxicity by modifying metal regulatory transcription factor 1, causing the inhibition of zinc-induced metallothionein transcription.

The DNA damage may be caused by hydroxyl radicals produced during reoxidation of pentavalent chromium by hydrogen peroxide molecules present in the cell. Trivalent chromium may also form complexes with peptides, proteins, and DNA, resulting in DNA-protein crosslinks, DNA strand breaks, DNA-DNA interstrand crosslinks, chromium-DNA adducts, chromosomal aberrations and alterations in cellular signaling pathways. It has been shown to induce carcinogenesis by overstimulating cellular regulatory pathways and increasing peroxide levels by activating certain mitogen-activated protein kinases. It can also cause transcriptional repression by cross-linking histone deacetylase 1-DNA methyltransferase 1 complexes to CYP1A1 promoter chromatin, inhibiting histone modification. Chromium may increase its own toxicity by modifying metal regulatory transcription factor 1, causing the inhibition of zinc-induced metallothionein transcription.

Four crystalline forms, (polymorphs) , of ZnCl2 are known, and in each case the Zn2+ ions are trigonal planar coordinated to four chloride ions. The pure anhydrous orthorhombic form rapidly changes to one of the other forms on exposure to the atmosphere and a possible explanation is that the presence of OH facilitates the rearrangement. Rapid cooling of molten ZnCl2 gives a glass, that is, a rigid amorphous solid and this ability has been related to the structure in the melt.<br /> Zinc chloride belongs to the family of Transition Metal Chlorides.

351,376,630,736,T3D0735,Zinc nitrate,"Zinc nitrate is a nitrate of zinc. It is used as a mordant in dyeing. Zinc is a metallic element with the atomic number 30. It is found in nature most often as the mineral sphalerite. Though excess zinc in harmful, in smaller amounts it is an essential element for life, as it is a cofactor for over 300 enzymes and is found in just as many transcription factors. Nitrite is a toxic compound known to cause methemoglobinemia. (L1137, L48, L49, L71) Zinc nitrate is a highly deliquescent substance which is usually prepared by dissolving zinc in nitric acid. It can be used as a mordant in dyeing. An example reaction gives a precipitate of zinc carbonate.",7779-88-6,24518.0,N2O6Zn,187.90478,Colorless crystals.,,,,Inhalation  (L49) ; oral (L49) ; dermal (L49),"Anaemia results from the excessive absorption of zinc suppressing copper and iron absorption, most likely through competitive binding of intestinal mucosal cells. Unbalanced levels of copper and zinc binding to Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase has been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Stomach acid dissolves metallic zinc to give corrosive zinc chloride, which can cause damage to the stomach lining. Metal fume fever is thought to be an immune response to inhaled zinc. Nitrate's toxicity is a result of it's conversion to nitrite once in the body. Nitrite causes the autocatalytic oxidation of oxyhemoglobin to hydrogen peroxide and methemoglobin. This elevation of methemoglobin levels is a condition known as methemoglobinemia, and is characterized by tissue hypoxia, as methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen. (A2450, L1613, L48, L49, A49)","Zinc can enter the body through the lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Intestinal absorption of zinc is controlled by zinc carrier protein CRIP. Zinc also binds to metallothioneins, which help prevent absorption of excess zinc. Zinc is widely distributed and found in all tissues and tissues fluids, concentrating in the liver, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, skin, lung, brain, heart, and pancreas. In the bloodstream zinc is found bound to carbonic anhydrase in erythrocytes, as well as bound to albumin, _2-macroglobulin, and amino acids in the the plasma. Albumin and amino acid bound zinc can diffuse across tissue membranes. Zinc is excreted in the urine and faeces. Intake of some amount of nitrates and nitrites is a normal part of the nitrogen cycle in humans. In vivo conversion of nitrates to nitrites can occur in the gastrointestional tract under the right conditions, significantly enhancing nitrates' toxic potency. The major metabolic pathway for nitrate is conversion to nitrite, and then to ammonia. Nitrites, nitrates, and their metabolites are excreted in the urine. (L1137, L49)","LD50: 1400 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (A200)",,Ingested nitrate or nitrite under conditions that result in endogenous nitrosation is probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A). (L135),Zinc nitrate is used as a mordant in dyeing. (L71),"Intermediate Oral: 0.3 mg/kg/day (L134) 
Chronic Oral: 0.3 mg/kg/day (L134)","Chronic exposure to zinc causes anemia, atazia, lethargy, and decreases the level of good cholesterol in the body. It is also believed to cause pancreatic and reproductive damage. Nitrate and nitrite poisoning causes methemoglobinemia. Nitrites may cause pregnancy complications and developmental effects. They may also be carcinogenic. (L1137, L49)","Ingestion of large doses of zinc causes stomach cramps, nausea, and vomiting. Acute inhalation of large amounts of zinc causes metal fume fever, which is characterized by chills, fever, headache, weakness, dryness of the nose and throat, chest pain, and coughing. Dermal contact with zinc results in skin irritation. Nitrate and nitrite poisoning causes methemoglobinemia. Symptoms include cyanosis, cardiac dysrhythmias and circulatory failure, and progressive central nervous system (CNS) effects. CNS effects can range from mild dizziness and lethargy to coma and convulsions. (L1137, L49)","Zinc poisoning is treated symptomatically, often by administering fluids such as water or milk, or with gastric lavage. Methemoglobinemia can be treated with supplemental oxygen and methylene blue 1% solution administered intravenously slowly over five minutes followed by IV flush with normal saline. Methylene blue restores the iron in hemoglobin to its normal (reduced) oxygen-carrying state.

356,383,645,754,T3D0753,Copper(I) cyanide,"Copper(I) cyanide is a chemical compound of copper and cyanide. It was used as a catalyst in polymerizations, in electroplating of copper and iron, and as insecticide, fungicide, and biocide in marine paints. Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu and atomic number 29. Copper is an essential elements in plants and animals as it is required for the normal functioning of more than 30 enzymes. It occurs naturally throughout the environment in rocks, soil, water, and air. (L277, L278, L98)",544-92-3,2724144.0,CCuN,88.93268,White to greenish powder.,474°C,,,Inhalation  (L96) ; oral (L96) ; dermal (L96),"Excess copper is sequestered within hepatocyte lysosomes, where it is complexed with metallothionein. Copper hepatotoxicity is believed to occur when the lysosomes become saturated and copper accumulates in the nucleus, causing nuclear damage. This damage is possibly a result of oxidative damage, including lipid peroxidation. Copper inhibits the sulfhydryl group enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and paraoxonases, which protect the cell from free oxygen radicals. It also influences gene expression and is a co-factor for oxidative enzymes such as cytochrome C oxidase and lysyl oxidase. In addition, the oxidative stress induced by copper is thought to activate acid sphingomyelinase, which lead to the production of ceramide, an apoptotic signal, as well as cause hemolytic anemia. Copper-induced emesis results from stimulation of the vagus nerve. Organic nitriles decompose into cyanide ions both in vivo and in vitro. Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97, L277, T49, A174, L280)","Copper is mainly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, but it can also be inhalated and absorbed dermally. It passes through the basolateral membrane, possibly via regulatory copper transporters, and is transported to the liver and kidney bound to serum albumin. The liver is the critical organ for copper homoeostasis. In the liver and other tissues, copper is stored bound to metallothionein, amino acids, and in association with copper-dependent enzymes, then partitioned for excretion through the bile or incorporation into intra- and extracellular proteins. The transport of copper to the peripheral tissues is accomplished through the plasma attached to serum albumin, ceruloplasmin or low-molecular-weight complexes. Copper may induce the production of metallothionein and ceruloplasmin. The membrane-bound copper transporting adenosine triphosphatase (Cu-ATPase) transports copper ions into and out of cells. Physiologically normal levels of copper in the body are held constant by alterations in the rate and amount of copper absorption, compartmental distribution, and excretion. Organic nitriles are converted into cyanide ions through the action of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. Cyanide is rapidly absorbed and distributed throughout the body.

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",Organic nitriles are converted into cyanide ions through the action of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. Cyanide is rapidly absorbed and distributed throughout the body. Cyanide is mainly metabolized into thiocyanate by either rhodanese or 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase. Cyanide metabolites are excreted in the urine. (L96),"LD50: 6440 ug/kg (Oral, Rat) (T14)

361,390,661,771,T3D0770,Ethanol,"Ethanol is a clear, colorless liquid rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body. It has bactericidal activity and is used often as a topical disinfectant. It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in alcoholic beverages. Indeed, ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption, including scents, flavorings, colorings, and medicines. Ethanol has a depressive effect on the central nervous system and because of its psychoactive effects, it is considered a drug. Ethanol has a complex mode of action and affects multiple systems in the brain, most notably it acts as an agonist to the GABA receptors. Death from ethanol consumption is possible when blood alcohol level reaches 0.4%. A blood level of 0.5% or more is commonly fatal. Levels of even less than 0.1% can cause intoxication, with unconsciousness often occurring at 0.3-0.4 %. Ethanol is metabolized by the body as an energy-providing carbohydrate nutrient, as it metabolizes into acetyl CoA, an intermediate common with glucose metabolism, that can be used for energy in the citric acid cycle or for biosynthesis. Ethanol within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and then into acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The product of the first step of this breakdown, acetaldehyde, is more toxic than ethanol. Acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol. It has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver,[77] multiple forms of cancer, and alcoholism. Industrially, ethanol is produced both as a petrochemical, through the hydration of ethylene, and biologically, by fermenting sugars with yeast. Small amounts of ethanol are endogenously produced by gut microflora through anaerobic fermentation. However most ethanol detected in biofluids and tissues likely comes from consumption of alcoholic beverages. Absolute ethanol or anhydrous alcohol generally refers to purified ethanol, containing no more than one percent water. Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. It often contains trace amounts of toxic benzene (used to remove water by azeotropic distillation). Consumption of this form of ethanol can be fatal over a short time period. Generally absolute or pure ethanol is used as a solvent for lab and industrial settings where water will disrupt a desired reaction. Pure ethanol is classed as 200 proof in the USA and Canada, equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the UK system.",64-17-5,702.0,C2H6O,46.04187,,-114.1°C,78.2°C,1E+006 mg/L (at 25°C),"Oral, rapidly absorbed. Blood alcohol level and the time necessary to achieve it are controlled largely by the rapidity and extent of ethanol consumption. (T10)","Alcohol binds to the GABA(A) receptors (delta subunit), NMDA receptors, Glycine receptors, Serotonin receptors, Acetylcholine receptors, L-channel calcium channels and GIRK channels.  Ethanol acts in the central nervous system primarily by binding to the GABAA receptor, increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Ethanol within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol. It has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver and multiple forms of cancer. During the metabolism of alcohol via the respective dehydrogenases, NAD (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is converted into reduced NAD. Normally, NAD is used to metabolise fats in the liver, and as such alcohol competes with these fats for the use of NAD. Prolonged exposure to alcohol means that fats accumulate in the liver, leading to the term 'fatty liver'. Continued consumption (such as in alcoholism) then leads to cell death in the hepatocytes as the fat stores reduce the function of the cell to the point of death. These cells are then replaced with scar tissue, leading to the condition called cirrhosis.","Ethanol is metabolized to acetaldehyde by three enzymes:
1. Alcohol dehydrogenase metabolized methanol  to acetaldehyde, which is oxidized by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase to acetate.
2. Catalase metabolizes ethanol by utilizing H2O2 supplied by the actionhs of NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase. This normally accounts for more than 10% of ethanol metabolism.
3. CYP2E1, is the principal component of the hepatic microsomal ethanol oxidizing system, MEOS)
(T10)","LD50: 5628 mg/kg (Oral, rat) ","The fatal dose of ethanol is 300-400 mL of pure ethanol (600-800 mL of 50% spirits), for the average adult if consumed in less than one hour. More specifically, the lethal dose of alcohol is 5-8g/kg (3g/kg for children).",Ethanol in alcoholic beverages is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). (L135),"Ethanol is used as a solvent in industry, in many household products and pharmaceuticals, and in intoxicating beverages. It is also used for therapeutic neurolysis of nerves or ganglia for the relief of intractable chronic pain in such conditions as inoperable cancer and trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux), in patients for whom neurosurgical procedures are contraindicated.",,"Acute: At 0.1% blood alcohol levels individuals experience CNS depression, nausea, possible vomiting, impaired cognition and impaired motor and sensory function. Accidents or injury can also occur due to the side effects of loss of coordination, slowed reaction time, sleepiness and impaired judgment. At >0.14% blood alcohol levels there is decreased blood flow to the brain.  At greater than 0.3% blood alcohol there is a marked degree of stupefaction and possible unconsciousness.  At levels greater than 0.4% there is a risk of death.  Acute consumption leading to blood alcohol levels greater than 0.5% is almost universally fatal.
Chronic: high levels of alcohol consumption are associated with an increased risk of alcoholism, malnutrition, chronic pancreatitis, alcoholic (fatty) liver disease, and cancer.  Frequent drinking of alcoholic beverages has been shown to be a major contributing factor in cases of elevated blood levels of triglycerides. In addition, damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from chronic alcohol abuse. The long-term use of alcohol is capable of damaging nearly every organ and system in the body. The developing adolescent brain is particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of alcohol. In addition, the developing fetal brain is also vulnerable, and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) may result if pregnant mothers consume alcohol. The net effect of alcohol consumption on global human health is quite detrimental, with an estimated 3.8% of all global deaths and 4.6% of global disability-adjusted life-years attributable to alcohol.  Ethanol is considered a teratogen (causing fetal alcohol syndrome) and a Group 1 carcinogen because of the carcinogenicity of acetaldehyde (a major metabolite of alcohol).","Symptoms and effects of overdose include nausea, vomiting, CNS depression, acute respiratory failure or death and with chronic use, severe health problems, such as liver and brain damage. At >0.14% blood alcohol levels there is decreased blood flow to the brain.  At greater than 0.3% blood alcohol there is a marked degree of stupefaction and possible unconsciousness.  At levels greater than 0.4% there is a risk of death.  Acute consumption leading to blood alcohol levels greater than 0.5% is almost universally fatal. With chronic alcohol abuse, severe health problems, such as liver and brain damage can be present.","If you suspect someone has alcohol poisoning, call for an ambulance to take them to a hospital. While you're waiting: try to keep them sitting up and awake, give them water if they can drink it. If they've passed out, lie them on their side in the recovery position and check they're breathing properly, keep them warm and stay with them and monitor their symptoms. Acute alcohol poisoning is a medical emergency due to the risk of death from respiratory depression and/or inhalation of vomit if emesis occurs while the patient is unconscious and unresponsive. Emergency treatment for acute alcohol poisoning strives to stabilize the patient and maintain a patent airway and respiration, while waiting for the alcohol to metabolize.  Emergency treatment in a hospital can involve: 1) treating hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) with 50 ml of 50% dextrose solution and saline flush, as ethanol induced hypoglycaemia is unresponsive to glucagon; 2) Administration of the vitamin thiamine to prevent Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which can cause a seizure; 3) application of haemodialysis if the blood concentration is dangerously high (>400 mg%), and especially if there is metabolic acidosis and 4) Providing oxygen therapy as needed via nasal cannula or non-rebreather mask.",2009-05-06 21:37:51+00:00,2014-12-24 20:22:48+00:00,Ethanol,,C00469,,16236.0,ETOH,D000431,Ethanol,DB00898,EOH,594.0,True,CCO,C2H6O,"InChI=1S/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3",InChIKey=LFQSCWFLJHTTHZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N,46.0684,46.041864814,Endogenous,Liquid,-0.31,HMDB00108,CHEMBL545,682.0,,"<p>William S.

362,391,663,773,T3D0772,Ethylene glycol ,"Ethylene glycol (monoethylene glycol (MEG), IUPAC name: ethane-1,2-diol) is an alcohol with two -OH groups (a diol), a chemical compound widely used as an automotive antifreeze. Ethylene glycol is toxic, and its accidental ingestion should be considered a medical emergency. (L1023)",107-21-1,174.0,C2H6O2,62.03678,"Odorless, colorless, syrupy liquid (L1023).",-13°C,,"1000 mg/mL [RIDDICK,JA et al. (1986)]",Oral (T29) ; dermal (T29),"Ethylene glycol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to glycoaldehyde, which is then metabolized to glycolic, glyoxylic, and oxalic acids. These acids, along with excess lactic acid are responsible for the anion gap metabolic acidosis. Oxalic acid readily precipitates with calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. Tissue injury is caused by widespread deposition of oxalate crystals and the toxic effects of glycolic and glyoxylic acids. Ethylene glycol produces central nervous system depression. The glycol probably causes the initial CNS depression; oxalate and the other intermediates seem to be responsible for nephrotoxicity. Glycoaldehyde and glyoxylate may be the principal metabolites responsible for EG nephrotoxicity and do so by causing ATP depletion and phospholipid and enzyme destruction. Glycine and acidosis, by-products of EG metabolism, can attenuate glyoxylate-mediated injury. This suggests that naturally occurring but incomplete protective pathways may be operative during the evolution of EG cytotoxicity. (A612, A613, A310)","The main steps in degradation of ethylene glycol are as follows: ethylene glycol--> glycoaldehyde--> glycolic and glyoxylic acid. Glyoxylic acid is then metabolized into a number of chemicals that have been identified in expired air, urine, or blood. The metabolism of ethylene glycol to glycoaldehyde is mediated by alcohol dehydrogenase. Glycoaldehyde is metabolized to glycolic acid by aldehyde oxidase or to a lesser extent to glyoxal. Glyoxal is changed both to glycolic acid in the presence of lactic dehydrogenase, aldehyde oxidase, or possibly both enzymes, and to glyoxylic acid via some oxidative mechanism. The main path of the degradation of glycolic acid is to glyoxylic acid. This reaction is mediated by lactic dehydrogenase or glycolic acid oxidase. Once glyoxylic acid is formed, it is apparently degraded very rapidly to a variety of products, a few of which have been observed. Its breakdown to 2-hydroxy-3-oxoadipate it is thought, is mediated by thiamine pyrophosphate in the presence of magnesium ions. The formation of glycine involves pyridoxal phosphate and glyoxylate transaminase, whereas the formation of carbon dioxide and water via formic acid apparently involves coenzyme A (CoA) and flavin mononucleotides. Oxalic acid formation from glyoxylic acid, has been considered to be the results from the action of lactic dehydrogenase or glycolic acid oxidase. (T29)","LD50: 4700 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L1025)

Stage 3 of ethylene glycol poisoning is the result of kidney injury, leading to acute kidney failure. Oxalic acid reacts with calcium and forms calcium oxalate crystals in the kidney (L1023). ","Symptoms of ethylene glycol poisoning usually follow a three-step progression. Stage 1 consists of neurological symptoms including victims appearing to be intoxicated, exhibiting symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, slurred speech, and confusion. Over time, the body metabolizes ethylene glycol into other toxins, it is first metabolized to glycolaldehyde, which is then oxidized to glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid, and finally oxalic acid. Stage 2 is a result of accumulation of these metabolites and consists of tachycardia, hypertension, hyperventilation, and metabolic acidosis. Stage 3 of ethylene glycol poisoning is the result of kidney injury, leading to acute kidney failure. Oxalic acid reacts with calcium and forms calcium oxalate crystals in the kidney. (L1023, A2703)","Initial treatment consists of stabilizing the patient and gastric decontamination. Gastric lavage or nasogastric aspiration of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning. Ipecac-induced vomiting or activated charcoal. The antidotes for ethylene glycol poisoning are ethanol or fomepizole; antidotal treatment forms the mainstay of management following ingestion. Ethanol (usually given IV as a 5 or 10% solution in 5% dextrose and water, but also sometimes given in the form of a strong spirit such as whisky, vodka or gin) acts by competing with ethylene glycol for the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase thus limiting the formation of toxic metabolites. Fomepizole acts by inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase, thus blocking the formation of the toxic metabolites.

365,397,678,798,T3D0797,Imidacloprid,"Imidacloprid is a neonicotinoid insecticide, which is a class of neuro-active insecticides modeled after nicotine.  Nicotine was identified and used as an insecticide and rat poison as early as the 1600’s. Its effectiveness as an insecticide spurred a search for insecticidal compounds that have selectively less effect on mammals, which led to the discovery of neonicotinoids. Neonicotinoids, like nicotine, bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of a cell. In mammals, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are located in cells of both the central and peripheral nervous systems. In insects these receptors are limited to the CNS. While low to moderate activation of these receptors causes nervous stimulation, high levels overstimulate and block the receptors causing paralysis and death. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are activated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is broken down by acetylcholinesterase to terminate signals from these receptors. However, acetylcholinesterase cannot break down neonicotinoids and the binding is irreversible. Because most neonicotinoids bind much more strongly to insect neuron receptors than to mammal neuron receptors, these insecticides are selectively more toxic to insects than mammals. The low mammalian toxicity of neonicotinoids can be explained in large part by their lack of a charged nitrogen atom at physiological pH. The uncharged molecule can penetrate the insect blood–brain barrier, while the mammalian blood–brain barrier filters it. However, Some neonicotinoid breakdown products are toxic to humans, especially if they have become charged. Because of their low toxicity and other favorable features, neonicotinoids are among the most widely used insecticides in the world.  Most neonicotinoids are water-soluble and break down slowly in the environment, so they can be taken up by the plant and provide protection from insects as the plant grows.  Neonicotinoids are currently used on corn, canola, cotton, sorghum, sugar beets and soybeans. They are also used on the vast majority of fruit and vegetable crops, including apples, cherries, peaches, oranges, berries, leafy greens, tomatoes, and potatoes. The use of neonicotinoids has been linked in a range of studies to adverse ecological effects, including honey-bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) and loss of birds due to a reduction in insect populations.  This has led to moratoriums and bans on their use in Europe.",105827-78-9,86418.0,C9H10ClN5O2,255.0523,Colorless crystals (L1130).,143 - 144°C,,,Inhalation (L1130) ; dermal (L1130) ; oral (L1130),Imidacloprid acts on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; the chlorination inhibits degradation by acetylcholine-esterase (L1130).,"Two main routes of metabolism responsible for the degradation of imidacloprid were identified. The first is oxidative cleavage, yielding 6-chloronicotinic acid, which is conjugated with glycine to form a hippuric acid-type conjugate. These two metabolites together represented most of the identified metabolites, or about 30% of the recovered radiolabel. Of minor importance in terms of quantity is dechlorination of the pyridinyl moiety, producing the 6-hydroxy nicotinic acid and its methylmercapturic acid derivative, probably as a degradation product of a glutathione conjugate. The 6-methylmercapto nicotinic acid conjugated with glycine, and the glycine conjugate constituted 5.6% of the recovered radiolabel. The second important biodegradation step starts with hydroxylation of the imidazolidine ring at the 4 or 5 position, and about 16% of the recovered radiolabel was identified as the sum of 4- and 5-hydroxy imidacloprid. The loss of water yields the olefinic compound. These biotransformation products and the unchanged parent compound were excreted in urine and feces, while the guanidine compound was a less important metabolite and was eliminated only in feces (A623).","LD50: 450 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L1130)

367,399,689,809,T3D0808,Paraquat dichloride,"Paraquat dichloride is a constituent of numerous proprietary herbicides. A large majority (93%) of fatalities from paraquat poisoning are cases of intentional self-administration, ie, suicides. In third world countries, paraquat is a major suicide agent. For instance, in Samoa from 1979-2001, 70% of suicides were by Paraquat poisoning. In Southern Trinidad from 1996-1997, 76% of suicides were by paraquat. However, independent bodies have studied paraquat in this use. Jenny Pronczuk de Garbino, stated: no lung or other injury in marijuana users has ever been attributed to paraquat contamination. Also a United States Environmental Protection Agency manual states: &hellip; toxic effects caused by this mechanism have been either very rare or nonexistent. Most paraquat that contaminates marijuana is pyrolyzed during smoking to dipyridyl, which is a product of combustion of the leaf material itself (including marijuana) and presents little toxic hazard. Paraquat is the trade name for N,N -dimethyl-4,4 -bipyridinium dichloride, one of the most widely used herbicides in the world. Paraquat, a viologen, is quick-acting and non-selective, killing green plant tissue on contact. It is also toxic to human beings when swallowed. Paraquat is used as a quaternary ammonium herbicide; one of the most widely used herbicides in the world. It is quick-acting, non-selective, and kills green plant tissue on contact. It is redistributed within the plant but does not harm mature bark. Being a herbicide, paraquat protects crops by controlling a wide range of annual and certain perennial weeds that reduce crop yield and quality by competing with the crop for water, nutrients, and light. Pure paraquat ingested is highly toxic to mammals and humans potentially leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and there are no specific antidotes. However, fuller's earth or activated charcoal is an effective treatment, if taken in time. Death may occur up to 30 days after ingestion. Diluted paraquat used for spraying is less so, thus the greatest risk of accidental poisoning is during mixing and loading Paraquat for use.",1910-42-5,15938.0,C12H14Cl2N2,256.0534,Off-white powder (L421).,>400°C,,700 mg/mL at 20°C,Inhalation (T44) ; oral (T44) ; eye contat (T44) ; dermal (T44),"The mechanisms of the toxic effects of paraquat are largely the result of a metabolically catalyzed single electron oxidation reduction reaction, resulting in depletion of cellular NADPH and the generation of potentially toxic forms of oxygen such as the superoxide radical (A607). Recent studies have demonstrated paraquat cytotoxicity occurs in the mitochondria and particularly in mitochondrial-rich tissues. The mitochondrial NADH-dependent PQ reductase containing a voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1)  appears to be largely responsible for paraquat cytotoxicity. When mitochondria are incubated with NADH and paraquat, the superoxide anion is produced, and the mitochondria rupture.  Ruptured mitochondria lead to rapid cell death (A3102).","Paraquat is poorly absorbed after oral exposure. It is not metabolized but is reduced to an unstable free radical which is then re-oxidized to reform the cation and produce a superoxide anion. It is excreted moslty in the urine,and in small fraction also in the feces (A606, L1008). ","LD50: 150 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L1008)

It is also often used in science to catalyze the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  (L421).,,"It can cause temporary damage to nails and if swalloed, may cause nose bleeding. Long term exposures to paraquat would most likely cause lung and eye damage. Some suspect a possible link to a greater incidence of Parkinson's disease. Pancreatitis may develop in some cases of acute. Paraquat is caustic to the oral, esophageal, and gastric mucosa (T36, A545, L421).","Eye or skin irritation; hypotension may develop after large ingestion;  epistaxis and sore throat may develop after inhalation. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common (T36).","In case of  oral exposure, administer charcoal as a slurry. Consider after ingestion of a potentially life-threatening amount of poison if it can be performed soon after ingestion. The treatment is symptomatic and supportive. In case of eye exposure, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. In case of dermal exposure, remove contaminated clothing and jewellery. Wash the skin, including hair and nails, vigorously; do repeated soap washings. Discard contaminated clothing.

Mirex is only moderately toxic in single-dose animal studies (oral LD50 values range from 365Р3000 mg/kg body weight).[6] It can enter the body via inhalation, ingestion, and via the skin. The most sensitive effects of repeated exposure in animals are principally associated with the liver, and these effects have been observed with doses as low as 1.0 mg/kg diet (0.05 mg/kg body weight per day), the lowest dose tested. At higher dose levels, it is fetotoxic (25 mg/kg in diet) and teratogenic (6.0 mg/kg per day). Mirex was not generally active in short-term tests for genetic activity.

370,402,713,870,T3D0868,4-Chlorophenol,4-Chlorophenol or para-chlorophenol is a monochlorophenol isomer that has a chlorine atom in the para position. It is used as a disinfectant agent (L159).,106-48-9,,C6H5ClO,,White powder.,42.8°C,,"24 mg/mL at 25°C [ROBERTS,MS et al. (1977)]",Inhalation (L159) ; oral (L159) ; dermal (L159),"4-chlorophenol works as a weak uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation and inhibitors of cellular respiration. The ability of chlorophenols to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation increases with increasing chlorination. In fact, studies indicate a concentration-dependent triphasic effect of chlorophenols on phosphorylation and cellular respiration. At low concentrations, uncoupling produces stimulation of the resting state respiration as a result of increased adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity in the absence of a phosphate acceptor.Inhibition of active respiration is also observed. At moderate concentrations, resting respiration is neither stimulated nor inhibited. Significant inhibition of respiration, associated with a breakdown of the electron transport process and decreased ATPase activity, occurs at very high concentrations. Uncoupling activity has been attributed to a protonophoric effect (a disruption of the energy gradient across the mitochondrial membrane resulting from distribution of chlorophenols in the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane), whereas inhibition of cellular respiration has been attributed to a direct action on intracellular proteins (L159).",Absorption of 4-chlorophenol is favored in the stomach and the intestine. Absorption through the gastrointestinal tract is by simple diffusion and is expected to be both rapid and virtually complete. It is proposed that 4-CP is metabolized by P-450 enzymes to intermediates that react with glutathione to form glutathionyl adducts.The metabolism of the 4-chlorophenol is principally via conjugation. The principal metabolite ecreted is the glucuronide. Other metabolites are sulfate conjugates such as the ethereal sulfate. The metabobites are excreted in urine (L159). ,"LD50: 670 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L724)

It produce effects ranging from slight hyperemia to severe corrosion when applied to the corneas. Acute inhalation exposure may lead to hemorrhage in the lungs and tachypnea. Oral exposure to 2-chlorophenol can produce a variety of neurological effects, including tremors, myoclonic convulsions, a hunched posture, dyspnea, collapse, and coma (L159). ","Cough, shortness of breath and sore throat can result from inhalation of 2-chlorophenol. These symptoms may be delayed. Abdominal pain, drowsiness, weakness, and convulsions can result from ingestion as well as inhalation. moreover, ingestion of 2-chlorophenol can cause restlessness, tremors, or central nervous system depression to occur. Eye exposure to 2-chlorophenol can lead to redness, pain, and blurred vision, while dermal contact can lead to redness and pain of the skin. Moreover, the substance can be rapidily absorbed after derma exposure (L159).","Avoid dilution following oral exposure; instead, administer charcoal as a slurry. Following inhalation, move patient to fresh air. Monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids. If the exposure occurs through eye contact, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. Following dermal exposure, remove phenol with undiluted polyethylene glycol 300 to 400 or isopropyl alcohol prior to washing, if readily available. Wash exposed areas twice or for at least 10 minutes with large quantities of soapy water. Water alone may be harmful.

Antimony can covalently interact with sulfhydryl groups and phosphate, as well as numerous reversible binding interactions with endogenous ligands (e.g., proteins). It is not known if these interactions are toxicologically significant. Antimony is excreted via the urine and feces.

Carbamate pesticides are derived from carbamic acid and kill insects in a similar fashion as organophosphate insecticides. They are widely used in homes, gardens and agriculture. Aldicarb is effective against thrips, aphids, spider mites, lygus, fleahoppers, and leafminers, but is primarily used as a nematicide. Aldicarb is effective where resistance to organophosphate insecticides has developed, and is extremely important in potato production, where it is used for the control of soil-borne nematodes and some foliar pests. Its weakness is its high level of solubility, which restricts its use in certain areas where the water table is close to the surface. Most of the carbamates are extremely toxic to Hymenoptera, and precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to foraging bees or parasitic wasps. Aldicarb was one of the 'dirty dozen' pesticides that the environmental group Pesticide Action Network North America targeted in 1985. EPA put a ban in place in 2010, requiring an end to distribution by 2017.

Carbamates form unstable complexes with chlolinesterases by carbamoylation of the active sites of the enzymes.  This inhibition is reversible. A cholinesterase inhibitor suppresses the action of acetylcholine esterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholine esterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses.  Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are often prominent at higher levels of exposure. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax.

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Chronically high (>10 years) exposure leads to neuropsychological consequences including disturbances in perception and visuo-motor processing (A15321).","As with organophosphates, the signs and symptoms are based on excessive cholinergic stimulation. Unlike organophosphate poisoning, carbamate poisonings tend to be of shorter duration because the inhibition of nervous tissue acetylcholinesterase is reversible, and carbamates are more rapidly metabolized.

378,411,771,948,T3D0944,Carbofuran,"Carbofuran is a carbamate pesticide. It is used as systemic agricultural insecticide, acaricide and nematocide. Carbofuran has been shown to exhibit neuroprotectant and neuroprotective functions (A7790, A7790). Carbofuran belongs to the family of Benzofurans. These are organic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to a furan.",1563-66-2,2566.0,C12H15NO3,221.10519,White powder.,150 - 152°C,,0.32 mg/mL at 25°C,Inhalation  (L793) ; oral (L793); dermal (L793),"Carbofuran is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. Carbamates form unstable complexes with chlolinesterases by carbamoylation of the active sites of the enzymes.  This inhibition is reversible. A cholinesterase inhibitor suppresses the action of acetylcholine esterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholine esterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses.  Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are often prominent at higher levels of exposure. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop.",The carbamates are hydrolyzed enzymatically by the liver; degradation products are excreted by the kidneys and the liver. (L793),"LD50: 5 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) 
LD50: 120 mg/kg (Dermal, Rat) 
LD50: 450 ug/kg (Intravenous, Mouse) ",,No indication of carcinogenicity to humans (not listed by IARC).,"Carbofuran is widely used as an insecticide or pesticide in homes, gardens and agricultural applications. It is a synthetic compound.",,"Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Chronically high (>10 years) exposure leads to neuropsychological consequences including disturbances in perception and visuo-motor processing (A15321).","As with organophosphates, the signs and symptoms are based on excessive cholinergic stimulation. Unlike organophosphate poisoning, carbamate poisonings tend to be of shorter duration because the inhibition of nervous tissue acetylcholinesterase is reversible, and carbamates are more rapidly metabolized. Muscle weakness, dizziness, sweating and slight body discomfort are commonly reported early symptoms. Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are often prominent at higher levels of exposure. Contraction of the pupils with blurred vision, incoordination, muscle twitching and slurred speech have been reported. (L795)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-06-17 23:53:02+00:00,2014-12-24 20:22:58+00:00,,,C14291,,34611.0,,D002235,Carbofuran,,,252.0,True,CN=C(O)OC1=CC=CC2=C1OC(C)(C)C2,C12H15NO3,"InChI=1S/C12H15NO3/c1-12(2)7-8-5-4-6-9(10(8)16-12)15-11(14)13-3/h4-6H,7H2,1-3H3,(H,13,14)",InChIKey=DUEPRVBVGDRKAG-UHFFFAOYSA-N,221.2524,221.105193351,Exogenous,Solid,2.32,HMDB31770,CHEMBL416081,2468.0,,,,"2, 3-Dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranyl methylcarbamate

A pyrethroid is a synthetic chemical compound similar to the natural chemical pyrethrins produced by the flowers of pyrethrums (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and C. coccineum). Pyrethroids are common in commercial products such as household insecticides and insect repellents. In the concentrations used in such products, they are generally harmless to human beings but can harm sensitive individuals. They are usually broken apart by sunlight and the atmosphere in one or two days, and do not significantly affect groundwater quality except for being toxic to fish.

They appear to bind to the membrane lipid phase in the immediate vicinity of the sodium channel, thus modifying the channel kinetics. This blocks the closing of the sodium gates in the nerves, and thus prolongs the return of the membrane potential to its resting state. The repetitive (sensory, motor) neuronal discharge and a prolonged negative afterpotential produces effects quite similar to those produced by DDT, leading to hyperactivity of the nervous system which can result in paralysis and/or death. Other mechanisms of action of pyrethroids include antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, modulation of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, enhancement of noradrenaline release, and actions on calcium ions. They also inhibit calium channels and Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase. (T10, T18, L857)","Upon absorption of allethrine , biotransformation takes place through hydrolysis of the

central ester bond, oxidative attacks at several sites, and conjugation reactions to produce a complex array of primary and secondary water-soluble metabolites that undergo urinary and biliary excretion. Allethrin is oxidized not only at the chrysanthemate isobutenyl moiety to the corresponding primary alcohol but also at the allyl group to 1'-hydroxyprop-2'-enyl and 2',3'-dihydroxy-propyl derivatives, or at a methyl group on the cyclopropyl moiety to a hydroxy derivative. It is widely accepted that metabolism results in the formation of compounds that have little or no demonstrable toxicity, although the formation of reactive or toxic intermediates cannot be ruled out, and it appears that cleavage of the ester bond results in substantial detoxification.  Allethrin is also converted to chrysanthemum dicarboxylic acid and allethrolone. Allethrin leaves the body quickly, mainly in the urine, but also in feces and breath.

If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids.

It is a non-systemic chemical used to control cutworms, ants, silverfish, cockroaches, termites, grain beetles, weevils, mosquitoes, fleas, flies, corn earworms, tobacco budworm, codling moth, European corn borer, cabbageworm, loopers, armyworms, boll weevil, alfalfa weevil, Colorado potato beetle, and many others. Its primary agricultural uses have been for control of chewing and sucking insects on crops such as cotton, turf, ornamentals, hops, cereal, corn, deciduous fruit, peanuts, potatoes, and other vegetables. Cyfluthrin is also used in public health situations and for structural pest control.

They appear to bind to the membrane lipid phase in the immediate vicinity of the sodium channel, thus modifying the channel kinetics. This blocks the closing of the sodium gates in the nerves, and thus prolongs the return of the membrane potential to its resting state. The repetitive (sensory, motor) neuronal discharge and a prolonged negative afterpotential produces effects quite similar to those produced by DDT, leading to hyperactivity of the nervous system which can result in paralysis and/or death. Other mechanisms of action of pyrethroids include antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, modulation of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, enhancement of noradrenaline release, and actions on calcium ions. They also inhibit calium channels and Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase. (T10, T18, L857)","The initial step in cyfluthrin biotransformation is ester hydrolysis, giving a 3-phenoxy-4-fluorobenzyl alcohol intermediate and the permethric acid fraction. After ester hydrolysis, the 3-phenoxy-4-fluorobenzyl alcohol moiety is oxidized to the free metabolite 3-phenoxy-4-fluorobenzoic acid. This metabolite can then either be conjugated with glycine to form 3-phenoxy-4-fluorohippuric acid or hydroxylated to give 4'-hydroxy-3-phenoxy-4-fluorobenzoic acid. The metabolites as well as a small pert of the unmetabolized compound are excreted in the urine in the feces. (L857, A562)","LD50: 869-1271 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L862)

A pyrethroid is a synthetic chemical compound similar to the natural chemical pyrethrins produced by the flowers of pyrethrums (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and C. coccineum). Pyrethroids are common in commercial products such as household insecticides and insect repellents. In the concentrations used in such products, they are generally harmless to human beings but can harm sensitive individuals. They are usually broken apart by sunlight and the atmosphere in one or two days, and do not significantly affect groundwater quality except for being toxic to fish.

The main route of metabolism is, as anticipated, via hydrolysis of the ester linkage. The cyclopropane-carboxylic acid moiety is subsequently excreted via the urine as  the glucuronide conjugate. The 3-phenoxybenzyl moiety is further metabolized by loss of the nitrile group, oxidation of the aldehyde form to a carboxylic acid, aromatic hydroxylation at the 4' position, and formation of the 4- O-sulfate conjugate of 3-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)benzoic acid.

385,422,858,1039,T3D1035,Deltamethrin,"Deltamethrin is a pyrethroid (type 2) ester insecticide. This material is a member of one of the safest classes of pesticides: synthetic pyrethroids. While mammalian exposure to deltamethrin is classified as safe, this pesticide is highly toxic to aquatic life, particularly fish, and therefore must be used with extreme caution around water. A pyrethroid is a synthetic chemical compound similar to the natural chemical pyrethrins produced by the flowers of pyrethrums (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and C. coccineum). Pyrethroids are common in commercial products such as household insecticides and insect repellents. In the concentrations used in such products, they are generally harmless to human beings but can harm sensitive individuals. They are usually broken apart by sunlight and the atmosphere in one or two days, and do not significantly affect groundwater quality except for being toxic to fish. Since deltamethrin is a neurotoxin, it temporarily attacks (in medical terms, insults) the nervous system of any animal with which it comes into contact. Skin contact can lead to tingling or reddening of the skin local to the application. If taken in through the eyes or mouth, a common symptom is facial paraesthesia, which can feel like many different abnormal sensations, including burning, partial numbness, pins and needles, skin crawling, etc.",52918-63-5,40585.0,C22H19Br2NO3,502.97317,Colourless crystalline powder (L874).,100°C,,2e-06 mg/mL at 25°C,Inhalation (L857) ; oral (L857) ; dermal (L857) ; eye contact (L857).,"Both type I and type II pyrethroids exert their effect by prolonging the open phase of the sodium channel gates when a nerve cell is excited. They appear to bind to the membrane lipid phase in the immediate vicinity of the sodium channel, thus modifying the channel kinetics. This blocks the closing of the sodium gates in the nerves, and thus prolongs the return of the membrane potential to its resting state. The repetitive (sensory, motor) neuronal discharge and a prolonged negative afterpotential produces effects quite similar to those produced by DDT, leading to hyperactivity of the nervous system which can result in paralysis and/or death. Other mechanisms of action of pyrethroids include antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, modulation of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, enhancement of noradrenaline release, and actions on calcium ions. They also inhibit calium channels and Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase. (T10, T18, L857)","Deltamethrin is readily absorbed by the oral route, but less so dermally; absorbed deltamethrin is readily metabolized and excreted. The major degradation pathway of cypermethrin is hydrolysis of the ester linkage to (yield ultimately) 3-phenoxybenzoic acid and 3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2- dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid. (From the cis-isomer both cis- and trans- cyclopropanecarboxylic acids are found.) A minor degradative route is ring hydroxylation to give an alpha-cyano-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)benzyl ester followed by hydrolysis to produce the corresponding hydroxycarboxylic acid (A558).","LD50: 4123 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (A563)

At lower doses, commonly observed effects include paresthesia and erythema (L863).","Following dermal exposure to deltamethrin, feelings of numbness, itching, burning, stinging, tingling, or warmth may occur, that could last for a few hours. Ddizziness, headache, nausea, muscle twitching, reduced energy, and changes in awareness can reult from inhalation or ingestion of large amounts of deltamethrin. Paralysis can occur after exposure  (L857).","Following oral exposure, the treatment is symptomatic and supportive and includes monitoring for the development of hypersensitivity reactions with respiratory distress. Provide adequate airway management when needed. Gastric decontamination is usually not required unless the pyrethrin product is combined with a hydrocarbon. Following inhalation exposure, move patient to fresh air. monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids. In case of eye exposure, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. If irritation, pain, swelling, lacrimation, or photophobia persist, the patient should be seen in a health care facility.

386,423,859,1040,T3D1036,Esfenvalerate,"Esfenvalerate is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide which is used on a wide range of pests such as moths, flies, beetles, and other insects. It is used on vegetable crops, tree fruit, and nut crops. It may be mixed with a wide variety of other types of pesticides such as carbamate compounds or organophosphates. Esfenvalerate has replaced the naturally occurring compound fenvalerate (to which it is almost identical) for use in the U.S. Much of the data for fenvalerate is applicable to the pesticide esfenvalerate because the two compounds contain the same components. The only differences in the two products are the relative proportions of the four separate constituents (isomers). Esfenvalerate has become the preferred compound because it requires lower applications rates than fenvalerate, is less chronically toxic, and is a more powerful insecticide. The compound contains a much higher percentage of the one insecticidally active isomer (84% for esfenvalerate and 22% for fenvalerate). A pyrethroid is a synthetic chemical compound similar to the natural chemical pyrethrins produced by the flowers of pyrethrums (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and C. coccineum).

It is a mixture of four optical isomers which have different insecticidal activities. The 2-S alpha (or SS) configuration is the most insecticidally active isomer. Fenvalerate consists of about 23% of this isomer. (Wikipedia) Fenvalerate has been shown to exhibit steroidogenic function (A7791).Fenvalerate belongs to the family of Pyrethroids. These are organic compounds similar to the pyrethrins.

(1983); SEAWATER]",Oral (L96) ; inhalation (L96) ; dermal (L96),"Both type I and type II pyrethroids exert their effect by prolonging the open phase of the sodium channel gates when a nerve cell is excited. They appear to bind to the membrane lipid phase in the immediate vicinity of the sodium channel, thus modifying the channel kinetics. This blocks the closing of the sodium gates in the nerves, and thus prolongs the return of the membrane potential to its resting state. The repetitive (sensory, motor) neuronal discharge and a prolonged negative afterpotential produces effects quite similar to those produced by DDT, leading to hyperactivity of the nervous system which can result in paralysis and/or death. Other mechanisms of action of pyrethroids include antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, modulation of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, enhancement of noradrenaline release, and actions on calcium ions. They also inhibit calium channels and Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase. (T10, T18, L857)","Following ingestion, pyrethriods are hydrolysed by various digestive enzymes in the gastro-intestinal tract. However, a small portion of the insecticidally active compounds or its derivatives are absorbed, as shown by their toxicity and their effect on the liver. Pyrethriods may also be absorbed following inhalation or dermal contact. They are rapidly distributed to most tissues, particularly to those with a high lipid content, and are concentrated in central and peripheral nervous tissues. Pyrethriods or their metabolites are not known to be stored in the body or to be excreted in the milk, but no study of the matter has employed modern methods. The major metabolic pathways for pyrethriods are hydrolysis of the central ester bond, oxidative attacks at several sites, and conjugation reactions, to produce a complex array of primary and secondary water-soluble metabolites that undergo urinary excretion. Metabolism is believed to involve nonspecific microsomal carboxyesterases and microsomal mixed function oxidases, which are located in nearly all tissue types, with particularly high activities in the liver. Metabolites are excreted in the urine and faeces. (L857, L889)","LD50: 70.2 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T13)

The use of fluvalinate has been discontinued and replaced by tau-fluvalinate which is derived from one isomer (the R-form) of fluvalinate. A pyrethroid is a synthetic chemical compound similar to the natural chemical pyrethrins produced by the flowers of pyrethrums (Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium and C. coccineum). Pyrethroids are common in commercial products such as household insecticides and insect repellents. In the concentrations used in such products, they are generally harmless to human beings but can harm sensitive individuals. They are usually broken apart by sunlight and the atmosphere in one or two days, and do not significantly affect groundwater quality except for being toxic to fish.

Ester hydrolysis leads to formation of anilino acid. The anilino acid is further conjugated with amino acids (glycine, serine, threonine, and valine), bile acids (cholic, taurochoric, and taurochenodeoxycholic), and glycerols (oleoyl- and linoleoylglycerol). In addition, an amide derivative of anilino acid was found. These conjugation reactions of anilino acid with bile acid (cholic acid, taurocholic acid, and taurochenodeoxycholic acid) and with glycerol and monoglycerides have rarely been reported as conjugates with xenobiotics. The major urinary metabolites are anilino acid, its hydroxymethyl derivative, its glycine conjugate, haloaniline, and sulfate conjugate of hydroxyhaloaniline. On the other hand, the major fecal metabolites are anilino acid, its amide derivative, and several conjugates of anilino acid with several endogenous components. An unexpected difference between fluvalinate and other pyrethroids is the minimal amt of hydroxylation at the 4'-position of the alcohol moiety.

389,426,894,1094,T3D1090,Propachlor,"Propachlor is widely used as a selective herbicide worldwide in corn, soybean and other crop cultures. Elevated concentrations of these herbicides and their degradation products have been detected in surface and groundwater. Propachlor is a pre-emergence herbicide, effective against annual grasses and certain broad-leaved weeds. It is a compound of the family of chloroacetanilides. (A252, L904)",1918-16-7,4931.0,C11H14ClNO,211.07639,Tan colored solid (L904).,77°C,,"0.58 mg/mL at 25°C [TOMLIN,C (2003)]",Oral (L904) ; inhalation (L904) ; dermal (L904) ; dermal (L904).,"Propachlor poisoning causes an induction of microsomal hepatic UDPGT activity, which produces increased clearance of thyroid hormone, T4. Decreased levels of T4 would result in increased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Increased levels of TSH would result in the hyperplastic and eventually tumorigenic response of the thyroid. Propachlor metabolites also bind to nAChRs in the nervous system and cause endocrine disruption in humans by binding to and inhibiting the estrogen receptor. (T10, A570, T152)","Propachlor can be absorbed in mammals through the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts as well as through the skin.  It does not accumulate in the body, since it is rapidly metabolized through the mercapturic acid pathway (MAP). Cysteine conjugates are formed by glutathione conjugation and this conjugate has been proposed as an intermediate in the metabolic formation of mercapturic acid conjugation.  It has been shown that a cysteine conjugate of propachlor is the source of sulfur in methylsulfonyl- containing metabolites, but that the carbon in the methylsulfonyl group does not come from the cysteine moiety. Propachlor is conjugated firstly with glutathione and the reaction is mediated by glutathione transferases. The glutathione conjugation provides a means for inactivation of reactive electrophiles. Glutathione conjugates have the required physico-chemical properties for biliary excretion and will generally be present, together with their catabolites cysteinyl-glycine, cysteine and N-acetylcysteine-mercapturic acid, in relatively high concentrations in the bile. After excretion with the bile, they are metabolized in the intestine where the C-S lyase present cleaves the cysteine conjugate, allowing further metabolism of sulfur to a methylsulfonyl-containing moiety. Eleven urinary metabolites, six of which are 2-methylsulfonylacetanalides have been isolated. The major fecal metabolite is identified as the cysteine conjugate.

It is used in dietary supplements and to treat conditions such as acne vulgaris, common cold, hypertension, premature labor, Leishmaniasis, visceral postoperative complications. Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu and atomic number 29. Copper is an essential elements in plants and animals as it is required for the normal functioning of more than 30 enzymes. It occurs naturally throughout the environment in rocks, soil, water, and air.

Copper hepatotoxicity is believed to occur when the lysosomes become saturated and copper accumulates in the nucleus, causing nuclear damage. This damage is possibly a result of oxidative damage, including lipid peroxidation. Copper inhibits the sulfhydryl group enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and paraoxonases, which protect the cell from free oxygen radicals. It also influences gene expression and is a co-factor for oxidative enzymes such as cytochrome C oxidase and lysyl oxidase. In addition, the oxidative stress induced by copper is thought to activate acid sphingomyelinase, which lead to the production of ceramide, an apoptotic signal, as well as cause hemolytic anemia. Copper-induced emesis results from stimulation of the vagus nerve. (L277, T49, A174, L280)","Copper is mainly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, but it can also be inhalated and absorbed dermally. It passes through the basolateral membrane, possibly via regulatory copper transporters, and is transported to the liver and kidney bound to serum albumin. The liver is the critical organ for copper homoeostasis. In the liver and other tissues, copper is stored bound to metallothionein, amino acids, and in association with copper-dependent enzymes, then partitioned for excretion through the bile or incorporation into intra- and extracellular proteins. The transport of copper to the peripheral tissues is accomplished through the plasma attached to serum albumin, ceruloplasmin or low-molecular-weight complexes. Copper may induce the production of metallothionein and ceruloplasmin. The membrane-bound copper transporting adenosine triphosphatase (Cu-ATPase) transports copper ions into and out of cells. Physiologically normal levels of copper in the body are held constant by alterations in the rate and amount of copper absorption, compartmental distribution, and excretion.

405,444,983,1198,T3D1194,Copper(I) oxide,"Copper(I) oxide is an oxide of copper. It is found naturally as the mineral cuprite and is formed by the slow oxidation of copper when exposed to oxygen. Copper(I) oxide is commonly used as a pigment, a fungicide, and an antifouling agent for marine paints. It is also a semiconductor. Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu and atomic number 29. Copper is an essential elements in plants and animals as it is required for the normal functioning of more than 30 enzymes. It occurs naturally throughout the environment in rocks, soil, water, and air.

Copper hepatotoxicity is believed to occur when the lysosomes become saturated and copper accumulates in the nucleus, causing nuclear damage. This damage is possibly a result of oxidative damage, including lipid peroxidation. Copper inhibits the sulfhydryl group enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and paraoxonases, which protect the cell from free oxygen radicals. It also influences gene expression and is a co-factor for oxidative enzymes such as cytochrome C oxidase and lysyl oxidase. In addition, the oxidative stress induced by copper is thought to activate acid sphingomyelinase, which lead to the production of ceramide, an apoptotic signal, as well as cause hemolytic anemia. Copper-induced emesis results from stimulation of the vagus nerve. (L277, T49, A174, L280)","Copper is mainly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, but it can also be inhalated and absorbed dermally. It passes through the basolateral membrane, possibly via regulatory copper transporters, and is transported to the liver and kidney bound to serum albumin. The liver is the critical organ for copper homoeostasis. In the liver and other tissues, copper is stored bound to metallothionein, amino acids, and in association with copper-dependent enzymes, then partitioned for excretion through the bile or incorporation into intra- and extracellular proteins. The transport of copper to the peripheral tissues is accomplished through the plasma attached to serum albumin, ceruloplasmin or low-molecular-weight complexes. Copper may induce the production of metallothionein and ceruloplasmin. The membrane-bound copper transporting adenosine triphosphatase (Cu-ATPase) transports copper ions into and out of cells. Physiologically normal levels of copper in the body are held constant by alterations in the rate and amount of copper absorption, compartmental distribution, and excretion.

414,453,1008,1229,T3D1225,Copper chloride hydroxide,"Copper chloride hydroxide is a chemical compound of copper. Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu and atomic number 29. Copper is an essential elements in plants and animals as it is required for the normal functioning of more than 30 enzymes. It occurs naturally throughout the environment in rocks, soil, water, and air. (L277, L278)",1332-65-6,11969527.0,ClCu2H3O3,211.83627,Green crystals.,,,,Oral  (L277) ; inhalation  (L277) ; dermal (L277),"Excess copper is sequestered within hepatocyte lysosomes, where it is complexed with metallothionein. Copper hepatotoxicity is believed to occur when the lysosomes become saturated and copper accumulates in the nucleus, causing nuclear damage. This damage is possibly a result of oxidative damage, including lipid peroxidation. Copper inhibits the sulfhydryl group enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and paraoxonases, which protect the cell from free oxygen radicals. It also influences gene expression and is a co-factor for oxidative enzymes such as cytochrome C oxidase and lysyl oxidase. In addition, the oxidative stress induced by copper is thought to activate acid sphingomyelinase, which lead to the production of ceramide, an apoptotic signal, as well as cause hemolytic anemia. Copper-induced emesis results from stimulation of the vagus nerve. (L277, T49, A174, L280)","Copper is mainly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, but it can also be inhalated and absorbed dermally. It passes through the basolateral membrane, possibly via regulatory copper transporters, and is transported to the liver and kidney bound to serum albumin. The liver is the critical organ for copper homoeostasis. In the liver and other tissues, copper is stored bound to metallothionein, amino acids, and in association with copper-dependent enzymes, then partitioned for excretion through the bile or incorporation into intra- and extracellular proteins. The transport of copper to the peripheral tissues is accomplished through the plasma attached to serum albumin, ceruloplasmin or low-molecular-weight complexes. Copper may induce the production of metallothionein and ceruloplasmin. The membrane-bound copper transporting adenosine triphosphatase (Cu-ATPase) transports copper ions into and out of cells. Physiologically normal levels of copper in the body are held constant by alterations in the rate and amount of copper absorption, compartmental distribution, and excretion.

Organotin compounds stimulate the neuronal release of and/or decrease of neuronal cell uptake of neurotransmitters in brain tissue, including aspartate, GABA, glutamate, norepinephrine, and serotonin. This may be either a contributing factor to or result of the neuronal cell loss. The immunotoxic effects of organotins are characterized by thymic atrophy caused by the suppression of proliferation of immature thymocytes and apoptosis of mature thymocytes. Organotin compounds are believed to exert these effects by suppressing DNA and protein synthesis, inducing the expression of genes involved in apoptosis (such as nur77), and disrupting the regulation of intracellular calcium levels, giving rise to the uncontrolled production of reactive oxygen species, release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and the proteolytic and nucleolytic cascade of apoptosis. The suppression of proliferation of immature thymocytes further results in the suppression of T-cell-mediated immune responses.

Organotins may directly activate glial cells contributing to neuronal cell degeneration by local release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-_, and/or interleukins. They may also induce apoptosis by direct action on neuronal cells. Organotin compounds stimulate the neuronal release of and/or decrease of neuronal cell uptake of neurotransmitters in brain tissue, including aspartate, GABA, glutamate, norepinephrine, and serotonin. This may be either a contributing factor to or result of the neuronal cell loss. The immunotoxic effects of organotins are characterized by thymic atrophy caused by the suppression of proliferation of immature thymocytes and apoptosis of mature thymocytes. Organotin compounds are believed to exert these effects by suppressing DNA and protein synthesis, inducing the expression of genes involved in apoptosis (such as nur77), and disrupting the regulation of intracellular calcium levels, giving rise to the uncontrolled production of reactive oxygen species, release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and the proteolytic and nucleolytic cascade of apoptosis. The suppression of proliferation of immature thymocytes further results in the suppression of T-cell-mediated immune responses.

It is a poisonous metalloid that has many allotropic forms: yellow (molecular non-metallic) and several black and grey forms (metalloids) are a few that are seen. Three metalloidal forms of arsenic with different crystal structures are found free in nature (the minerals arsenopyrite and the much rarer arsenolamprite and pararsenolamprite), but it is more commonly found as a compound with other elements.

At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and by competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Arsenic's carginogenicity is influenced by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. The binding of other arsenic protein targets may also cause altered DNA repair enzyme activity, altered DNA methylation patterns and cell proliferation. (T1, A17)","Arsenic is absorbed mainly by inhalation or ingestion, as to a lesser extent, dermal exposure. It is then distributed throughout the body, where it is reduced into arsenite if necessary, then methylated into monomethylarsenic (MMA) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) by arsenite methyltransferase. Arsenic and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Arsenic is known to induce the metal-binding protein metallothionein, which decreases the toxic effects of arsenic and other metals by binding them and making them biologically inactive, as well as acting as an antioxidant.

426,474,1098,1325,T3D1321,Phenarsazine oxide,"Phenarsazine oxide is an organoarsenic compound. Arsenic is a chemical element that has the symbol As and atomic number 33. It is a poisonous metalloid that has many allotropic forms: yellow (molecular non-metallic) and several black and grey forms (metalloids) are a few that are seen. Three metalloidal forms of arsenic with different crystal structures are found free in nature (the minerals arsenopyrite and the much rarer arsenolamprite and pararsenolamprite), but it is more commonly found as a compound with other elements.

At the level of the citric acid cycle, arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase and by competing with phosphate it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of NAD+, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which might form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Arsenic's carginogenicity is influenced by the arsenical binding of tubulin, which results in aneuploidy, polyploidy and mitotic arrests. The binding of other arsenic protein targets may also cause altered DNA repair enzyme activity, altered DNA methylation patterns and cell proliferation. (T1, A17)","Arsenic is absorbed mainly by inhalation or ingestion, as to a lesser extent, dermal exposure. It is then distributed throughout the body, where it is reduced into arsenite if necessary, then methylated into monomethylarsenic (MMA) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) by arsenite methyltransferase. Arsenic and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Arsenic is known to induce the metal-binding protein metallothionein, which decreases the toxic effects of arsenic and other metals by binding them and making them biologically inactive, as well as acting as an antioxidant.

Arsenic is also a known carcinogen, esepcially in skin, liver, bladder and lung cancers. (T1, L20)","Exposure to lower levels of arsenic can cause nausea and vomiting, decreased production of red and white blood cells, abnormal heart rhythm, damage to blood vessels, and a sensation of ","Arsenic poisoning can be treated by chelation therapy, using chelating agents such as dimercaprol, EDTA or DMSA. Charcoal tablets may also be used for less severe cases. In addition, maintaining a diet high in sulfur helps eliminate arsenic from the body.

It has been shown to induce carcinogenesis by overstimulating cellular regulatory pathways and increasing peroxide levels by activating certain mitogen-activated protein kinases. It can also cause transcriptional repression by cross-linking histone deacetylase 1-DNA methyltransferase 1 complexes to CYP1A1 promoter chromatin, inhibiting histone modification. Chromium may increase its own toxicity by modifying metal regulatory transcription factor 1, causing the inhibition of zinc-induced metallothionein transcription. Nitrate's toxicity is a result of it's conversion to nitrite once in the body. Nitrite causes the autocatalytic oxidation of oxyhemoglobin to hydrogen peroxide and methemoglobin. This elevation of methemoglobin levels is a condition known as methemoglobinemia, and is characterized by tissue hypoxia, as methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen. (A2450, L1613, A12, L16, A34, A35, A36)","Chromium is absorbed from oral, inhalation, or dermal exposure and distributes to nearly all tissues, with the highest concentrations found in kidney and liver. Bone is also a major storage site and may contribute to long-term retention. Hexavalent chromium's similarity to sulfate and chromate allow it to be transported into cells via sulfate transport mechanisms. Inside the cell, hexavalent chromium is reduced first to pentavalent chromium, then to trivalent chromium by many substances including ascorbate, glutathione, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Chromium is almost entirely excreted with the urine. Intake of some amount of nitrates and nitrites is a normal part of the nitrogen cycle in humans. In vivo conversion of nitrates to nitrites can occur in the gastrointestional tract under the right conditions, significantly enhancing nitrates' toxic potency. The major metabolic pathway for nitrate is conversion to nitrite, and then to ammonia. Nitrites, nitrates, and their metabolites are excreted in the urine. (L1137, A12, L16)","LD50: 3250 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L533)",,Ingested nitrate or nitrite under conditions that result in endogenous nitrosation is probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A). Chromium (III) compounds are not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3). (L135),Chromium nitrate is used in the production of alkali metal-free catalysts and in pickling. (L517),,"Chromium in its trivalent state is not very toxic. It may be oxidized to hexavalent chromium, a known carcinogen. Hexavalent chromium has also been shown to affect reproduction and development. Nitrate and nitrite poisoning causes methemoglobinemia. Nitrites may cause pregnancy complications and developmental effects. They may also be carcinogenic. (L1137, A12)","Chromium in its trivalent state is not very toxic, but it may be oxidized to hexavalent chromium. Breathing hexavalent chromium can cause irritation to the lining of the nose, nose ulcers, runny nose, and breathing problems, such as asthma, cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Ingestion of hexavalent chromium causes irritation and ulcers in the stomach and small intestine, as well as anemia. Skin contact can cause skin ulcers. Nitrate and nitrite poisoning causes methemoglobinemia. Symptoms include cyanosis, cardiac dysrhythmias and circulatory failure, and progressive central nervous system (CNS) effects. CNS effects can range from mild dizziness and lethargy to coma and convulsions. (L1137, L16)","There is no know antidote for chromium poisoning. Exposure is usually handled with symptomatic treatment. Methemoglobinemia can be treated with supplemental oxygen and methylene blue 1% solution administered intravenously slowly over five minutes followed by IV flush with normal saline.

437,490,1234,1508,T3D1504,Aluminium hydroxide,"Aluminium hydroxide is the most stable form of aluminium. It is found in nature as the mineral gibbsite (also known as hydrargillite) and its three, much more rare, polymorphs: bayerite, doyleite and nordstrandite. Aluminum hydroxide is used as an antacid and included as an adjuvant in some vaccines. Aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust and is always found combined with other elements such as oxygen, silicon, and fluorine.  (L739, L740, L756)",21645-51-2,6328211.0,AlH6O3,81.01323,White powder. ,300°C,,,Oral (L739) ; inhalation (L739),"The main target organs of aluminum are the central nervous system and bone. Aluminum binds with dietary phosphorus and impairs gastrointestinal absorption of phosphorus. The decreased phosphate body burden results in osteomalacia (softening of the bones due to defective bone mineralization) and rickets. Aluminum's neurotoxicity is believed to involve several mechanisms. Changes in cytoskeletal protein functions as a results of altered phosphorylation, proteolysis, transport, and synthesis are believed to be one cause. Aluminum may induce neurobehavioral effects by affecting permeability of the blood-brain barrier, cholinergic activity, signal transduction pathways, lipid peroxidation, and impair neuronal glutamate nitric oxide-cyclic GMP pathway, as well as interfere with metabolism of essential trace elements because of similar coordination chemistries and consequent competitive interactions. It has been suggested that aluminum's interaction with estrogen receptors increases the expression of estrogen-related genes and thereby contributes to the progression of breast cancer (A235), but studies have not been able to establish a clear link between aluminum and increased risk of breast cancer (A15468). Certain aluminum salts induce immune responses by activating inflammasomes. (L739, A235, A236)","Aluminum is poorly absorbed following either oral or inhalation exposure and is essentially not absorbed dermally. The bioavailability of aluminum is strongly influenced by the aluminum compound and the presence of dietary constituents which can complex with aluminum and enhance or inhibit its absorption. Aluminum binds to various ligands in the blood and distributes to every organ, with highest concentrations found in bone and lung tissues. In living organisms, aluminum is believed to exist in four different forms: as free ions, as low-molecular-weight complexes, as physically bound macromolecular complexes, and as covalently bound macromolecular complexes. Absorbed aluminum is excreted principally in the urine and, to a lesser extent, in the bile, while unabsorbed aluminum is excreted in the faeces.

438,491,1248,1524,T3D1520,Aluminium phosphide,"Aluminium phosphide is a phosphide of aluminum. It is a wide band gap semiconductor and is used as a rodenticide, insecticide and fumigant for stored cereal grains. Aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust and is always found combined with other elements such as oxygen, silicon, and fluorine.  Metal phosphides are hydrolysed to phosphine upon contact with water or stomach acid. Phosphine is a colorless, flammable, explosive, and toxic gas. (L980, L739, L740, L770)",20859-73-8,30332.0,AlP,57.9553,Yellow or gray crystals.,,,,Oral (L739) ; Inhalation (L739),"The main target organs of aluminum are the central nervous system and bone. Aluminum binds with dietary phosphorus and impairs gastrointestinal absorption of phosphorus. The decreased phosphate body burden results in osteomalacia (softening of the bones due to defective bone mineralization) and rickets. Aluminum's neurotoxicity is believed to involve several mechanisms. Changes in cytoskeletal protein functions as a results of altered phosphorylation, proteolysis, transport, and synthesis are believed to be one cause. Aluminum may induce neurobehavioral effects by affecting permeability of the blood-brain barrier, cholinergic activity, signal transduction pathways, lipid peroxidation, and impair neuronal glutamate nitric oxide-cyclic GMP pathway, as well as interfere with metabolism of essential trace elements because of similar coordination chemistries and consequent competitive interactions. It has been suggested that aluminum's interaction with estrogen receptors increases the expression of estrogen-related genes and thereby contributes to the progression of breast cancer (A235), but studies have not been able to establish a clear link between aluminum and increased risk of breast cancer (A15468). Certain aluminum salts induce immune responses by activating inflammasomes.   Phosphine inhibits cytochrome c oxidase, preventing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This non-competitive inhibition prevents cellular respiration and leads to multi-organ dysfunction. Phosphine can also react with hydrogen peroxide to form the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, which can cause lipid peroxidation. (A291, A292, L739, A235, A236)","Aluminum is poorly absorbed following either oral or inhalation exposure and is essentially not absorbed dermally. The bioavailability of aluminum is strongly influenced by the aluminum compound and the presence of dietary constituents which can complex with aluminum and enhance or inhibit its absorption. Aluminum binds to various ligands in the blood and distributes to every organ, with highest concentrations found in bone and lung tissues. In living organisms, aluminum is believed to exist in four different forms: as free ions, as low-molecular-weight complexes, as physically bound macromolecular complexes, and as covalently bound macromolecular complexes. Absorbed aluminum is excreted principally in the urine and, to a lesser extent, in the bile, while unabsorbed aluminum is excreted in the faeces.   Phosphine and metal phosphides may be absorbed following ingestion or inhalation, then distribute to the nervous system, liver, and kidney. In the body, metal phosphides are hydrolysed to phosphine, and phosphine is oxidized to hypophosphite and phosphite. Metabolites are excreted in the urine, while unchanged phosphine is exhaled.

The accumulation of aluminum in the body may cause bone or brain diseases. High levels of aluminum have been linked to Alzheimer's disease. A small percentage of people are allergic to aluminium and experience contact dermatitis, digestive disorders, vomiting or other symptoms upon contact or ingestion of products containing aluminium. Inhalation of phosphine may cause severe pulmonary irritation leading to acute pulmonary oedema, cardiovascular dysfunction, CNS excitation, coma and death. Gastrointestinal disorders, renal damage and leukopenia may also occur. Chronic exposure to phosphine can result in anemia, bronchitis, gastrointestinal effects, and visual, speech and motor problems.

A small percentage of people are allergic to aluminium and experience contact dermatitis, digestive disorders, vomiting or other symptoms upon contact or ingestion of products containing aluminium. Early symptoms of acute phosphine intoxication include pain in the diaphragm, nausea, vomiting, excitement, and a phosphorus smell on the breath. Higher levels can cause weakness, bronchitis, pulmonary edema, shortness of breath, convulsions, and death. Some effects, such as pulmonary edema, convulsions, and liver injury, may appear or continue to be present days after an exposure. Ingestion of metal phosphides results in release of phosphine in your stomach which can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

Mild forms of argyria are sometimes mistaken for cyanosis.

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Cyanide is rapidly alsorbed through oral, inhalation, and dermal routes and distributed throughout the body.

(L135)",,,"Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Cyanide poisoning is identified by rapid, deep breathing and shortness of breath, general weakness, giddiness, headaches, vertigo, confusion, convulsions/seizures and eventually loss of consciousness. (L96, L97)","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-06-22 16:08:25+00:00,2014-12-24 20:24:24+00:00,,,,,53556.0,CPD-1125,D014051,"2,4-Toluene diisocyanate",,,3795.0,True,CC1=CC=C(C=C1N=C=O)N=C=O,C9H6N2O2,"InChI=1S/C9H6N2O2/c1-7-2-3-8(10-5-12)4-9(7)11-6-13/h2-4H,1H3",InChIKey=DVKJHBMWWAPEIU-UHFFFAOYSA-N,174.1561,174.042927446,Exogenous,Liquid,,,CHEMBL1086446,13835351.0,,,,"2,4 Toluenediisocyanate

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",Organic nitriles are converted into cyanide ions through the action of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. Cyanide is rapidly absorbed and distributed throughout the body. Cyanide is mainly metabolized into thiocyanate by either rhodanese or 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase. Cyanide metabolites are excreted in the urine.

(L616),,"Exposure to high levels of cyanide for a short time harms the brain and heart and can even cause coma, seizures, apnea, cardiac arrest and death. Chronic inhalation of cyanide causes breathing difficulties, chest pain, vomiting, blood changes, headaches, and enlargement of the thyroid gland. Skin contact with cyanide salts can irritate and produce sores. (L96, L97)","Cyanide poisoning is identified by rapid, deep breathing and shortness of breath, general weakness, giddiness, headaches, vertigo, confusion, convulsions/seizures and eventually loss of consciousness. (L96, L97)","Antidotes to cyanide poisoning include hydroxocobalamin and sodium nitrite, which release the cyanide from the cytochrome system, and rhodanase, which is an enzyme occurring naturally in mammals that combines serum cyanide with thiosulfate, producing comparatively harmless thiocyanate. Oxygen therapy can also be administered.

465,535,1493,1791,T3D1787,Bromomethane,"Bromomethane (or methyl bromide) is an organobromide compound that may be produced both synthetically and by naturally marine organisms and certain terrestrial plants. It was used extensively as a pesticide and as a fire extinguisher component until being phased out by most countries in the early 2000s, as it is considered an ozone-depleting substance. The primary use of methyl bromide is/was as a fumigant in soil to control fungi, nematodes, and weeds; in space fumigation of food commodities (e.g., grains); and in storage facilities (such as mills, warehouses, vaults, ships, and freight cars) to control insects and rodents. Its popularity as a fumigant is largely attributable to its high toxicity to many pests, the variety of settings in which it can be applied, its ability to penetrate the fumigated substances, and its rapid dissipation following application. Trace amounts of methyl bromide have been detected in drinking water.  There are many reports of humans who have died following acute inhalation exposure to bromomethane. Most cases have involved accidental exposures associated with manufacturing or packaging operations, use of fire extinguishers containing bromomethane, or fumigation activities. Death is not immediate, but usually occurs within l-2 days of exposure. The cause of death is not certain, but is probably due to neurological and lung injury.",74-83-9,6323.0,CH3Br,93.94181,Colorless gas.,-93.7°C,,15.2 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L626) ; inhalation (L626) ; dermal (L626),"Organobromide compounds such as bromomethane are strong alkylating agents.  Consequently they can readily modify free thiols (cysteines) and methionine residues of the surfaces of proteins leading to the disruption of enzyme, transporter or membrane functions. The bromide ion (which is produced from bromomethane metabolism in the body) is known to affect the central nervous system, causing a condition called bromism. This is believed to be a result of bromide ions substituting for chloride ions in the in actions of neurotransmitters and transport systems, thus affecting numerous synaptic processes. (L626, L627, T104). However, the exact mechanism of toxicity for methyl bromide is currently uncertain, although its alkylating property as well as the reactive intermediates formed through metabolic transformation remain attractive hypotheses.","Bromomethane undergoes initial metabolism primarily by nucleophilic displacement of the bromide ion. When the attacking species is water, the products are methanol and bromide ion. Bromomethane may also react with organic thiols (R-SH) to yield S-methyl derivatives. This has been shown to result in formation of S-methylcysteine derivatives in hemoglobin of mice exposed to bromomethane. Further metabolism of methanol or S-methyl derivatives then leads to the formation of carbon dioxide.

LD50: 1540 mg/m3 over 2 hours (Inhalation, Mouse) (T14)","Lethality has been reported in humans following exposure to 60,000 ppm for 2 hours and 1,600-8,000 ppm for 4-6 hours. ","3, not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans. (L135)","The primary use of methyl bromide is as a fumigant in soil to control fungi, nematodes, and weeds; in space fumigation of food commodities (e.g., grains); and in storage facilities (such as mills, warehouses, vaults, ships, and freight cars) to control insects and rodents. In most places, levels of methyl bromide in the air are usually < 0.025 parts per billion (ppb).  Industrial areas have higher levels (ranging up to 1.2 ppb) because of releases from chemical factories. Workers who fumigate homes and fields may be exposed to high levels of methyl bromide if proper safety precautions are not followed.
",,Bromomethane is highly toxic. Studies in humans indicate that the lung may be severely injured by the acute (short-term) inhalation of bromomethane.  Acute and chronic (long-term) inhalation of bromomethane can lead to neurological effects in humans.  Neurological effects have also been reported in animals.  Degenerative and proliferative lesions in the nasal cavity developed in rats chronically exposed to bromomethane by inhalation.  Chronic inhalation exposure of male animals has resulted in effects on the testes at high concentrations. Studies in humans indicate that the lung may be most severely injured by the acute inhalation exposure of bromomethane.  The kidney is also sensitive to bromomethane. Anuria and proteinuria are common signs of renal injury in acutely exposed humans.,"Breathing modest amounts of bromomethane may lead to the development of a headache, nausea and weakness after several hours. Breathing high concentrations of bromomethane may cause pulmonary edema, impairing respiratory function. Acute exposure by inhalation of bromomethane frequently leads to neurological effects in humans.  Symptoms of acute exposure in humans include headaches, dizziness, fainting, apathy, weakness, confusion, speech impairment, visual effects, numbness, twitching, and tremors; in severe cases paralysis and convulsions are possible. Bromomethane is irritating to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract.  Dermal exposure to bromomethane can cause itching, redness, and blisters in humans. Neurological effects, including lethargy, forelimb twitching, tremors, and paralysis, have also been observed after chronic exposure to bromomethane.

Its copolymer with vinyl chloride is also used for preparing films, for laminating fibers, and as rubber substitutes.

Consequently they can randomly modify the surfaces of proteins and lipids, leading to the disruption of enzyme, transporter or membrane functions.  Alkylation of DNA by alkylbromides may also lead to mutations. Vinyl bromide is metabolically activated by liver microsomal enzymes to intermediates that covalently bind to proteins and nucleic acids. Several lines of evidence suggest the involvement of the epoxides, i.e., bromoethylene oxide. Proven targets for alkylation are adenine, cytosine and guanine moieties in nucleic acids, and sulfhydryl groups of proteins. Vinylbromide reacts quickly with hepatic glutathione (GSH) leading to its rapid depletion and subsequent liver damage.","Bromine is mainly absorbed via inhalation, but may also enter the body through dermal contact.

Acute exposure of rats to very high concentrations via inhalation has resulted in liver and kidney damage and adverse neurological effects.

473,544,1547,1846,T3D1842,m-Cresol,"m-Cresol is an isomer of p-cresol and o-cresol. Cresols are organic compounds which are methylphenols. They are a widely occurring natural and manufactured group of aromatic organic compounds which are categorized as phenols (sometimes called phenolics). Depending on the temperature, cresols can be solid or liquid because they have melting points not far from room temperature. Like other types of phenols, they are slowly oxidized by long exposure to air and the impurities often give cresols a yellowish to brownish red tint. Cresols have an odor characteristic to that of other simple phenols, reminiscent to some of a medicine smell. Cresol solutions are used as household cleaners and disinfectants, perhaps most famously under the trade name Lysol. In the past, cresol solutions have been used as antiseptics in surgery, but they have been largely displaced in this role by less toxic compounds. Lysol was also advertised as a disinfecting vaginal douche in mid-twentieth century America. Cresols are found in many foods and in wood and tobacco smoke, crude oil, coal tar, and in brown mixtures such as creosote and cresylic acids, which are wood preservatives. Small organisms in soil and water produce cresols when they break down materials in the environment. Most exposures to cresols are at very low levels that are not harmful. When cresols are breathed, ingested, or applied to the skin at very high levels, they can be very harmful. Effects observed in people include irritation and burning of skin, eyes, mouth, and throat; abdominal pain and vomiting; heart damage; anemia; liver and kidney damage; facial paralysis; coma; and death. Breathing high levels of cresols for a short time results in irritation of the nose and throat. Aside from these effects, very little is known about the effects of breathing cresols, for example, at lower levels over longer times. Ingesting high levels results in kidney problems, mouth and throat burns, abdominal pain, vomiting, and effects on the blood and nervous system. Skin contact with high levels of cresols can burn the skin and damage the kidneys, liver, blood, brain, and lungs.

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Cresols can be absorbed following inhalation, oral, and dermal exposure. Once in the body they can distribute rapidly into many organs and tissues. Cresols undergo oxidative metabolism in the liver and are rapidly eliminated, mostly in the urine, as sulfate or glucuronide conjugates. The activation of cresols by oxidation involves tyrosinase and thyroid peroxidase, forming a reactive quinone methide. Experiments with recombinant P-450s demonstrated cresol metabolism was mediated by several P-450s including CYP2D6, 2C19, 1A2, 1A1, and 2E1.

They may be formed normally in the body from other compounds. Cresols are found in many foods and in wood and tobacco smoke, crude oil, coal tar, and in chemical mixtures used as wood preservatives. Small organisms in soil and water produce cresols when they break down materials in the environment. Breathing air containing cresols is the primary source of exposure. Exposure may also result from drinking contaminated water, eating contaminated food and coming into contact with liquids containing cresols. (L528)  ","Intermediate Oral: 0.1 mg/kg/day (L134) 
Chronic Oral: 0.1 mg/kg/day (L134)","Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Ingestion of cresols results in burning of the mouth and throat, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Inhalation or dermal exposure to cresols can produce irritation and corrosion at the site of contact. (L482)  ","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-06-23 17:19:25+00:00,2014-12-24 20:24:43+00:00,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m-Cresol,,C01467,,17231.0,CPD-112,C042041,"Cresol, Meta-",DB01776,CRS,3506.0,True,CC1=CC(O)=CC=C1,C7H8O,"InChI=1S/C7H8O/c1-6-3-2-4-7(8)5-6/h2-5,8H,1H3",InChIKey=RLSSMJSEOOYNOY-UHFFFAOYSA-N,108.1378,108.057514878,Endogenous,Liquid,1.96,HMDB02048,CHEMBL298312,21105871.0,,"<p>Gerd Leston, &#8220;Preparation of 5-sec-alkyl-m-cresol.&#8221; U.S. Patent US3992455, issued September, 1963.</p>",,"1-Hydroxy-3-methylbenzene

(1990)]",Inhalation  (L857) ; oral  (L857) ; dermal  (L857) ; eye contact (L857).,"Pyrethroids exert their effect by prolonging the open phase of the sodium channel gates when a nerve cell is excited. They appear to bind to the membrane lipid phase in the immediate vicinity of the sodium channel, thus modifying the channel kinetics. This blocks the closing of the sodium gates in the nerves, and thus prolongs the return of the membrane potential to its resting state. The repetitive (sensory, motor) neuronal discharge and a prolonged negative afterpotential produces effects quite similar to those produced by DDT, leading to hyperactivity of the nervous system which can result in paralysis and/or death. Other mechanisms of action of pyrethroids include antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, modulation of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, enhancement of noradrenaline release, and actions on calcium ions. (T18, L857)","Fenpropathrin has been shown to be well absorbed after oral administration, extensively metabolized, and eliminated as polar conjugates in urine.

The anilino acid is further conjugated with amino acids (glycine, serine, threonine, and valine), bile acids (cholic, taurochoric, and taurochenodeoxycholic), and glycerols (oleoyl- and linoleoylglycerol). In addition, an amide derivative of anilino acid was found. These conjugation reactions of anilino acid with bile acid (cholic acid, taurocholic acid, and taurochenodeoxycholic acid) and with glycerol and monoglycerides have rarely been reported as conjugates with xenobiotics. The major urinary metabolites are anilino acid, its hydroxymethyl derivative, its glycine conjugate, haloaniline, and sulfate conjugate of hydroxyhaloaniline. On the other hand, the major fecal metabolites are anilino acid, its amide derivative, and several conjugates of anilino acid with several endogenous components.

of the central ester bond, oxidative attacks at several sites, and conjugation reactions, to produce a
complex array of primary and secondary water-soluble metabolites that undergo urinary excretion.

In addition, pyrethrin II suffers attack on the pentadienyl side chain, possibly forming a 4'-5'-epoxide that is a precursor of two isomeric diols. Esterification also occurs during the metabolism of pyrethrin II. Metabolism is believed to involve nonspecific microsomal carboxyesterases and microsomal mixed function oxidases, which are located in nearly all tissue types, with particularly high activities in the liver. Metabolites, such as chrysanthemummonocarboxylic acid, are excreted in the urine and faeces. (L857, L889, A263).","LD50: 2370 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T58)

Paresthesia, severe corneal damage, hypotension and tachycardia, associated with anaphylaxis, can also occur following pyrethrin poisoning. (L857)","The clinical manifestations of inhalation exposure to pyrethrins can be local or systemic. Localized reactions confined to the upper respiratory tract include rhinitis, sneezing, scratchy throat, oral mucosal edema, and even laryngeal mucosal edema. Localized reactions of the lower respiratory tract include cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest pain. An asthmalike reaction occurs with acute exposures in sensitized patients. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis characterized by chest pain, cough, dyspnea, and bronchospasm may occur in an individual chronically exposed. Large amounts may cause nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, headache, and other central nervous system disturbances. (A566)","Following oral exposure, the treatment is symptomatic and supportive and includes monitoring for the development of hypersensitivity reactions with respiratory distress. Provide adequate airway management when needed. Gastric decontamination is usually not required unless the pyrethrin product is combined with a hydrocarbon. Following inhalation exposure, move patient to fresh air. monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids. In case of eye exposure, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. If irritation, pain, swelling, lacrimation, or photophobia persist, the patient should be seen in a health care facility. If the contamination occurs through dermal exposure, remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed area thoroughly with soap and water. A physician may need to examine the area if irritation or pain persists. Vitamin E topical application is highly effective in relieving parenthesis.

485,557,1615,1918,T3D1914,Ammonium perchlorate,"Ammonium perchlorate (AP) is a chemical compound with the formula NH4ClO4. It is the salt of ammonia and perchloric acid. Like other perchlorates, it is a powerful oxidizer. It is produced by reaction between ammonia and perchloric acid, or by double decomposition between an ammonium salt and sodium perchlorate. It crystallises in colorless rhombohedra with a relative density of 1.95. Like most ammonium salts, it decomposes before melting. Mild heating results in chlorine, nitrogen, oxygen and water, while strong heating may lead to explosions (L897).",7790-98-9,24639.0,ClH4NO4,116.98288,white granular (L897),Exothermic decomposition before melting at &gt;200°C [ 1 ],,"200 mg/mL at 25°C [ASHFORD,RD (1994)]",Inhalation (L894) ; oral (L894) ; dermal (L894) ;  eye contact (L894).,"The primary and most sensitive target of the perchlorate anion (perchlorate) is the thyroid gland. Perchlorate inhibits the transport of iodide (I-) from the blood into the thyroid follicle cells. The inhibition is thought to be accomplished by perchlorate competitively blocking iodide binding to a carrier, or sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), which catalyzes the simultaneous transfer of Na+ and I-across the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicle cells. Perchlorate inhibition of the NIS can limit the availability of iodide needed for the production of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which in turn, may affect the circulating levels of T4 and T3. All known effects of perchlorate on the thyroid hormone system derive directly or secondarily from the inhibition of the NIS. T3 is essential for normal development of the nervous system and for the regulation of metabolism of cells in nearly all tissues of the body. Disruption in the availability of T3 in target tissues can result in adverse effects on a wide variety of organs and systems (L894).",There is no evidence that ammonium perchlorate is metabolized in the body. It is rapidly eliminated from the body through the urinary tract (L894).,"LD50: 4200 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T13)

Organ systems affected by disturbances in T3 levels include the skin, cardiovascular system, pulmonary system, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, liver, blood, neuromuscular system, central nervous system, skeleton, male and female reproductive systems, and numerous endocrine organs, including the pituitary and adrenal glands. Such an array of secondary potential targets underscores the need to maintain an adequate level of circulating thyroid hormones. Perchlorate, an environmental contaminant, is known to disturb the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis by blocking iodide accumulation in the thyroid. Iodide deficiency can lead to hypothyroidism and goiter (L894, A267).","Irritating to skin, eyes, and respiratory system, depending on the route of exposure. Esophageal or gastrointestinal tract irritation could occur following exposures (L894).","In case of oral exposure, immediately dilute with 4 to 8 ounces (120 to 240 mol) of water or milk. Consider after ingestion of a potentially life-threatening amount of poison if it can be performed soon after ingestion (generally within 1 hour). Protect airway by placement in Trendelenburg and left lateral decubitus position or by endotracheal intubation. Control any seizures first.  Maintain ventilation and oxygenation and evaluate with frequent arterial blood gas or pulse oximetry monitoring. Early use of PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be needed. Following inhalation, Move patient to fresh air. Monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids. In case of acute lung injury, maintain ventilation and oxygenation and evaluate with frequent arterial blood gas or pulse oximetry monitoring. Following eye exposure, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. Following dermal exposure, remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed area thoroughly with soap and water. A physician may need to examine the area if irritation or pain persists. Treat dermal irritation or burns with standard topical therapy. Patients developing dermal hypersensitivity reactions may require treatment with systemic or topical corticosteroids or antihistamines.

486,558,1616,1919,T3D1915,Sodium perchlorate,Sodium perchlorate is a perchlorate of sodium and has the formula NaClO4. Sodium perchlorate melts with decomposition at 480 ,7601-89-0,522606.0,ClNaO4,121.93828,White crystalline solid (L898).,480°C,,"2100 mg/mL at 25°C [VOGT,H et al. (1986)]",Inhalation (L894) ; oral (L894) ; dermal (L894) ;  eye contact (L894).,"The primary and most sensitive target of the perchlorate anion (perchlorate) is the thyroid gland. Perchlorate inhibits the transport of iodide (I-) from the blood into the thyroid follicle cells. The inhibition is thought to be accomplished by perchlorate competitively blocking iodide binding to a carrier, or sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), which catalyzes the simultaneous transfer of Na+ and I-across the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicle cells. Perchlorate inhibition of the NIS can limit the availability of iodide needed for the production of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which in turn, may affect the circulating levels of T4 and T3. All known effects of perchlorate on the thyroid hormone system derive directly or secondarily from the inhibition of the NIS. T3 is essential for normal development of the nervous system and for the regulation of metabolism of cells in nearly all tissues of the body. Disruption in the availability of T3 in target tissues can result in adverse effects on a wide variety of organs and systems (L894).",There is no evidence that sodium perchlorate is metabolized in the body. It is rapidly eliminated from the body through the urinary tract (L894).,"LD50: 2100 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T21)",,No indication of carcinogenicity to humans (not listed by IARC).,Breathing in contaminated air; drinking contaminated water; eating contaminated food; dermal and eye exposure (L894).,Chronic Oral: 0.0007 mg/kg/day (L900),"Adverse effects on a wide variety of organ systems can result from disruption in the availability of T3 to target tissues. Organ systems affected by disturbances in T3 levels include the skin, cardiovascular system, pulmonary system, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, liver, blood, neuromuscular system, central nervous system, skeleton, male and female reproductive systems, and numerous endocrine organs, including the pituitary and adrenal glands. Such an array of secondary potential targets underscores the need to maintain an adequate level of circulating thyroid hormones. Perchlorate, an environmental contaminant, is known to disturb the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis by blocking iodide accumulation in the thyroid. Iodide deficiency can lead to hypothyroidism and goiter (L894, A267).","Irritating to skin, eyes, and respiratory system, depending on the route of exposure. Esophageal or gastrointestinal tract irritation could occur following exposures (L894).","In case of oral exposure, immediately dilute with 4 to 8 ounces (120 to 240 mol) of water or milk. Consider after ingestion of a potentially life-threatening amount of poison if it can be performed soon after ingestion (generally within 1 hour). Protect airway by placement in Trendelenburg and left lateral decubitus position or by endotracheal intubation. Control any seizures first.  Maintain ventilation and oxygenation and evaluate with frequent arterial blood gas or pulse oximetry monitoring. Early use of PEEP and mechanical ventilation may be needed. Following inhalation, Move patient to fresh air. Monitor for respiratory distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops, evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis, or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids. In case of acute lung injury, maintain ventilation and oxygenation and evaluate with frequent arterial blood gas or pulse oximetry monitoring. Following eye exposure, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. Following dermal exposure, remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed area thoroughly with soap and water. A physician may need to examine the area if irritation or pain persists. Treat dermal irritation or burns with standard topical therapy. Patients developing dermal hypersensitivity reactions may require treatment with systemic or topical corticosteroids or antihistamines.

Unlike psilocybin, a tryptamine, muscimol is a potent, selective agonist of the GABAA receptor. Amanita muscaria contains two main active ingredients, Ibotenic acid and its derivative Muscimol. Muscimol is the product of the decarboxylation or drying of ibotenic acid and it is thought that muscimol is as much as ten times more potent than ibotenic acid.

(A3101)","Muscimol is a potent GABAA agonist, activating the receptor for the brain's major inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. Muscimol actually binds to the same binding site on the GABAA receptor complex as GABA itself, as opposed to other GABAergic drugs such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines which bind to separate regulatory sites. GABAA receptors are widely distributed in the brain, and so when muscimol is administered, it alters neuronal activity in multiple regions including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. However while muscimol is conventionally thought of as a selective GABAA agonist, it is also a potent partial agonist at the GABAC receptor, and so its effects profile results from a combined action at both targets.

It is present in hundreds of species of fungi, including those of the genus Psilocybe, such as Psilocybe cubensis and Psilocybe semilanceata, but also reportedly isolated from a dozen or so other genera. Psilocybin mushrooms are commonly called ""sacred mushrooms,"" ""magic mushrooms,"" or more simply ""shrooms"". Possession, and in some cases usage, of psilocybin or psilocin has been outlawed in most countries across the globe. Proponents of its usage consider it to be an entheogen and a tool to supplement various types of practices for transcendence, including in meditation, psychonautics, and psychedelic psychotherapy. The intensity and duration of entheogenic effects of psilocybin mushrooms are highly variable, depending on species/cultivar of mushrooms, dosage, individual physiology, and set and setting. Though psilocybin rarely attracts much attention from mainstream media, when it does the focus tends to be on the recreational use, generally excluding any other uses of the drug.

(A3101)",Psilocybin is rapidly dephosphorylated in the body to psilocin which then acts as a partial agonist at the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor in the brain where it mimics the effects of serotonin (5-HT). Psilocin is an 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/2C agonist. (L1143),Psilocybin is rapidly dephosphorylated in the body to psilocin. Psilocybin is metabolized mostly in the liver where it becomes psilocin.

At low doses, hallucinatory effects may occur, including enhancement of colors and the animation of geometric shapes. Closed-eye hallucination may occur, where the affected individual may see multi-coloured geometric shapes and vivid imaginative sequences. At higher doses, hallucinatory effects increase and experiences tend to be less social and more introspective or entheogenic.

","Methotrexate anti-tumor activity is a result of the inhibition of folic acid reductase, leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis and inhibition of cellular replication. The mechanism involved in its activity against rheumatoid arthritis is not known.","After absorption, methotrexate undergoes hepatic and intracellular metabolism to form methotrexate polyglutamate, metabolites which by hydrolysis may be converted back to methotrexate. Methotrexate polyglutamates inhibit dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthetase. Small amounts of these polyglutamate metabolites may remain in tissues for extended periods; the retention and prolonged action of these active metabolites vary among different cells, tissues, and tumors. In addition, small amounts of methotrexate polyglutamate may be converted to 7-hydroxymethotrexate; accumulation of this metabolite may become substantial following administration of high doses of methotrexate, since the aqueous solubility of 7-hydroxymethotrexate is threefold to fivefold lower than that of the parent compound. Following oral administration of methotrexate, the drug also is partially metabolized by the intestinal flora.

This is the first drug that was specifically approved to help with mobility in these patients. FDA approved on January 22, 2010. 4-Aminopyridine is an organic compound with the formula H2NC5H4N. The molecule is one of the three isomeric amines of pyridine. 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) is prepared by the decarbonylation of pyridine-4-carboxyamide using sodium hypochlorite via the Hofmann rearrangement (L1082).",504-24-5,1727.0,C5H6N2,94.0531,Colourless solid (L1082).,157-161°C,273°C,74 g/L,"Inhalation (T52, T14) ; oral (T52, T14) ; dermal (T52, T14) ; intravenous (T52, T14)Orally-administered dalfampridine is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Tmax, immediate release form = 1 hour;Tmax, extended release form = 3.5 hours;Cmax, 10 mg extended release = 17.3 - 21.6 ng/mL; Relative bioavailability of 10 mg extended-release tablets compared to aqueous oral solution = 96%","4-Aminopyridine blocks potassium channels and thereby increases acetylcholine, and possibly noradrenaline, release at nerve terminals (A316). In MS, axons are progressively demyelinated which exposes potassium channels. As a result, there is a leak of potassium ions which results in the repolarization of cells and a decrease in neuronal excitability. The overall impact is the impairment of neuromuscular transmission as it is harder to trigger an action potential. Dalfampridine inhibits voltage-gated potassium channels in the CNS to maintain the transmembrane potential and prolong action potential. In other words, dalfampridine works to make sure that the current available is high enough to stimulate conduction in demyelinated axons that are exposed in MS patients. Furthermore, it facilitates neuromuscular and synaptic transmission by relieving conduction blocks in demyelinated axons.","Not extensively metabolized by the liver therefore drugs effecting the cytochrome P450 enzyme system that are concomitantly administered with dalfampridine are not expected to interact with each other. 4-Aminopyridine is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract. It is readily broken down, or metabolized, in the liver into removable compounds excreted in urine. After intravenous and oral absoprtion, the metabolites  were almost all excreted in the urine. It does not to concentrate or accumulate in skin. 4-Aminopyridine is excreted in urine and rapidly detoxified in the liver (T48, L1090). Metabolites include 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine and 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine sulfate and both are inactive. CYP2E1 is the enzyme responsible for 3-hydroxylation of dalfampridine. Route of Elimination: Almost all of the dose and its metabolites are completely eliminated by the kidneys after 24 hours. Urine (96%; 90% of total dose as unchanged drug);Feces (0.5%) Half Life: Immediate release form = 3.5 hours;Extended release form = 5.47 hours;  ","LD50, oral, mouse = 19 mg/kgLD50, oral, rat = 21 mg/kgLD50: 20-29 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L1090)LD50: 3.7 mg/kg (Oral, Dog) (L1090)LD50: 326 mg/kg (Dermal, Rabbit) (L1090)",,No indication of carcinogenicity to humans (not listed by IARC).,"Dalfampridine is a neurofunctional modifier that helps improve walking speed in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

495,570,2094,2612,T3D2571,Acetaminophen,"Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is commonly used for its analgesic and antipyretic effects. Its therapeutic effects are similar to salicylates, but it lacks anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, and gastric ulcerative effects. The excellent tolerability of therapeutic doses of paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a major factor in the very wide use of the drug. The major problem in the use of paracetamol is its hepatotoxicity after an overdose. Hepatotoxicity has also been reported after therapeutic doses, but critical analysis indicates that most patients with alleged toxicity from therapeutic doses have taken overdoses. Importantly, prospective studies indicate that therapeutic doses of paracetamol are an unlikely cause of hepatotoxicity in patients who ingest moderate to large amounts of alcohol. (A7820). Single doses of paracetamol are effective analgesics for acute postoperative pain and give rise to few adverse effects. (A7821). Acetaminophen (AAP) overdose and the resulting hepatotoxicity is an important clinical problem. In addition, AAP is widely used as a prototype hepatotoxin to study mechanisms of chemical-induced cell injury and to test the hepatoprotective potential of new drugs and herbal medicines. Because of its importance, the mechanisms of AAP-induced liver cell injury have been extensively investigated and controversially discussed for many years. (A7822).",103-90-2,1983.0,C8H9NO2,151.06333,White powder.,169-171°C,,1.4E+004 mg/L (at 25°C),"Oral, rapid and almost complete.","Paracetamol toxicity is one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide. The toxic effects of acetaminophen are due to a minor alkylating metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinone imine – also known as NAPQI), not acetaminophen itself nor any of the other major metabolites. Cytochromes P450 2E1 and 3A4 convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to NAPQI. This toxic metabolite reacts with sulfhydryl groups on proteins and with glutathione (GSH). NAPQI depletes the liver's natural antioxidant glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver, leading to liver failure. In animal studies, hepatic glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before hepatotoxicity occurs. More specifically, oxidation by NAPQI of GSH to GSSG (oxidized glutathione) and the reduction of GSSG back to GSH by the NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase appear to be responsible for the rapid oxidation of NADPH that occurs in hepatocytes incubated with NAPQI. Risk factors for toxicity include excessive chronic alcohol intake, fasting or anorexia nervosa, and the use of certain drugs such as isoniazid. At usual doses, paracetamol is quickly detoxified by combining irreversibly with the sulfhydryl group of glutathione to produce a non-toxic conjugate that is eventually excreted by the kidneys. The toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. ","Acetaminophen primarily undergoes glucuronidation (45-55% of the dose) in which this process is facilitated by UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B15 in the liver or UGT1A10 in the gut. 30-35% of the dose undergoes sulfation. This biotransformation is facilitated by SULT1A1, SULT1A3, SULT1A4, SULT1E1 and SULT2A1. A small percentage of acetaminophen is oxidized by CYP2E1 to form N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinone imine (NAPQI), a toxic metabolite which is then conjugated to glutathione and excreted renally. Studies suggest that CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 are the primary cytochrome P450 isozymes responsible for the generation of toxic metabolites. Accumulation of NAPQI may occur if primary metabolic pathways are saturated. Acetaminophen is metabolized primarily in the liver, where most of it is converted to inactive compounds by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide, and then excreted by the kidneys. Only a small portion is metabolized via the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The toxic effects of acetaminophen are due to a minor alkylating metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinone imine), not acetaminophen itself nor any of the major metabolites. This toxic metabolite reacts with sulfhydryl groups. At usual doses, it is quickly detoxified by combining irreversibly with the sulfhydryl group of glutathione to produce a non-toxic conjugate that is eventually excreted by the kidneys. The toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable.
Route of Elimination: Approximately 80% of acetaminophen is excreted in the urine after conjugation and about 3% is excreted unchanged.

It is commonly used for the relief of fever, headaches, and other minor aches and pains, and is a major ingredient in numerous cold and flu remedies.",,"Skin rashes, blood disorders and a swollen pancreas have occasionally happened in people taking the drug on a regular basis for a long time.","When taken at the recommended dose, side-effects of paracetamol are rare. Skin rashes, blood disorders and a swollen pancreas have occasionally happened in people taking the drug on a regular basis for a long time. The signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of nausea, vomiting, pallor, and sweating. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of metabolic acidosis and coma early in the course of poisoning.The second phase occurs between 24 and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in hepatocytes as they metabolize the paracetamol. The individual may experience right upper quadrant pain. Acute kidney failure may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either hepatorenal syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive hepatic necrosis leading to fulminant hepatic failure with complications of coagulation defects, hypoglycemia, kidney failure, hepatic encephalopathy, cerebral edema, sepsis, multiple organ failure, and death.","In adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Acetylcysteine, when used early in the course of treatment, reduces morbidity and virtually eliminating mortality associated with even a massive acetaminophen overdose.

496,571,2096,2616,T3D2575,Tramadol,"A narcotic analgesic proposed for moderate to severe pain. It may be habituating. Tramadol is also prepared as a variable release capsules, marketed under the brand name ConZip. For example, a 150 mg capsule will contain 37.5 mg of the immediate release form and 112.5 mg of the extended release form. Tramadol is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a narcotic analgesic proposed for moderate to severe pain. It may be habituating. Tramadol and its O-desmethyl metabolite (M1) are selective, weak OP3-receptor agonists. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. The analgesic properties of Tramadol can be attributed to norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake blockade in the CNS, which inhibits pain transmission in the spinal cord. The (+) enantiomer has higher affinity for the OP3 receptor and preferentially inhibits serotonin uptake and enhances serotonin release. The (-) enantiomer preferentially inhibits norepinephrine reuptake by stimulating alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors.",27203-92-5,33741.0,C16H25NO2,263.18853,Solid (A308).,180-181°C,,Soluble,"Inhalation.Racemic tramadol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration.

The major metabolic pathways appear to be N- and O- demethylation and glucuronidation or sulfation in the liver. One metabolite (O-desmethyltramadol, denoted M1) is pharmacologically active in animal models. CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 facilitates the biotransformation of tramadol to N-desmethyl-tramadol. CYP2D6 facilitates the biotransformation of tramadol to O-desmethyl-tramadol.  Racemic tramadol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. The mean absolute bioavailability of a 100 mg oral dose is approximately 75%.The mean peak plasma concentration of racemic tramadol and M1 occurs at two and three hours, respectively, after administration in healthy adults. Tramadol undergoes hepatic metabolism via the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2D6, being O- and N-demethylated to five different metabolites. Of these, M1 (O-Desmethyltramadol) is the most significant since it has 200 times the affinity of (+)-tramadol, and furthermore has an elimination half-life of nine hours, compared with six hours for tramadol itself. In the 6% of the population that have slow CYP2D6 activity, there is therefore a slightly reduced analgesic effect. Phase II hepatic metabolism renders the metabolites water-soluble, which are excreted by the kidneys. Thus, reduced doses may be used in renal and hepatic impairment (A308, L1160).Route of Elimination: Tramadol is eliminated primarily through metabolism by the liver and the metabolites are excreted primarily by the kidneys. Approximately 30% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, whereas 60% of the dose is excreted as metabolites.Half Life: Tramadol and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine with observed plasma half-lives of 6.3 and 7.4 hours for tramadol and M1, respectively.","LD50: 300-350 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (A2833)",,No indication of carcinogenicity to humans (not listed by IARC).,"Indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe pain. Consider for those prone to constipation or respiratory depression. Tramadol is used to treat postoperative, dental, cancer, and acute musculosketetal pain and as an adjuvant to NSAID therapy in patients with osteoarthritis (A308).",,"Serious potential consequences of overdosage are respiratory depression, lethargy, coma, seizure, cardiac arrest and death. The respiratory depressant effects include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in these patients (RxList, A308).  Medical problems can include congested lungs, liver disease, tetanus, infection of the heart valves, skin abscesses, anemia and pneumonia. Death can occur from overdose.","Overdose symptoms of a tramadol overdose may include drowsiness, shallow breathing, slow heartbeat, extreme weakness, cold or clammy skin, feeling light-headed, fainting, or coma. (L1328)","In treating an overdose, primary attention should be given to maintaining adequate ventilation along with general supportive treatment. While naloxone will reverse some, but not all, symptoms caused by overdosage with ULTRAM, the risk of seizures is also increased with naloxone administration.

497,572,2097,2617,T3D2576,Haloperidol,"A phenyl-piperidinyl-butyrophenone that is used primarily to treat schizophrenia and other psychoses. It is also used in schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorders, ballism, and tourette syndrome (a drug of choice) and occasionally as adjunctive therapy in mental retardation and the chorea of huntington disease. It is a potent antiemetic and is used in the treatment of intractable hiccups. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p279)",52-86-8,3559.0,C21H23ClFNO2,375.14013,"White to faintly yellowish, amorphous or micro-crystalline powder (A638).",151.5°C,,14 mg/L (at 25°C),"Inhalation, Oral (60%)","The precise mechanism whereby the therapeutic effects of haloperidol are produced is not known, but the drug appears to depress the CNS at the subcortical level of the brain, midbrain, and brain stem reticular formation. Haloperidol seems to inhibit the ascending reticular activating system of the brain stem (possibly through the caudate nucleus), thereby interrupting the impulse between the diencephalon and the cortex. The drug may antagonize the actions of glutamic acid within the extrapyramidal system, and inhibitions of catecholamine receptors may also contribute to haloperidol's mechanism of action. Haloperidol may also inhibit the reuptake of various neurotransmitters in the midbrain, and appears to have a strong central antidopaminergic and weak central anticholinergic activity. The drug produces catalepsy and inhibits spontaneous motor activity and conditioned avoidance behaviours in animals. The exact mechanism of antiemetic action of haloperidol has also not been fully determined, but the drug has been shown to directly affect the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) through the blocking of dopamine receptors in the CTZ.","Haloperidol is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but first-pass hepatic metabolism decreases oral bioavailability to 40 to 75%. Serum concentration peaks 0.5 to 4 hours after an oral dose. Following administration of haloperidol, the drug is distributed mainly into the liver, with lower concentrations being distributed into the brain, lung, kidneys, spleen, and heart. Although the exact metabolic fate has not been clearly established, it appears that haloperidol is principally metabolized in the liver. The drug appears to be metabolized principally by oxidative N-dealkylation of the piperidine nitrogen to form fluorophenylcarbonic acids and piperidine metabolites (which appear to be inactive), and by reduction of the butyrophenone carbonyl to the carbinol, forming hydroxyhaloperidol. Limited data suggest that the reduced metabolite, hydroxyhaloperidol, has some pharmacologic activity, although its activity appears to be less than that of haloperidol. Urinary metabolites include p-fluorophenaceturic acid, beta-p-fluorobenzoylpropionic acid, and several unidentified acids (A637, A566, A637).Half Life: 3 weeks","LD50: 128 mg/kg (Oral, Rat)LD50: 71 mg/kg (Oral, Mouse)LD50: 90 mg/kg (Oral, Dog)LD50: 165 mg/kg (Oral, Rat)",,No indication of carcinogenicity to humans (not listed by IARC).,"For the management of psychotic disorders (eg. schizophrenia) and delirium, as well as to control tics and vocal utterances of Tourette's syndrome (Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome).

Thiamine decomposes if heated. Thiamine was first discovered by Umetaro Suzuki in Japan when researching how rice bran cured patients of Beriberi. Thiamine plays a key role in intracellular glucose metabolism and it is thought that thiamine inhibits the effect of glucose and insulin on arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. Thiamine plays an important role in helping the body convert carbohydrates and fat into energy. It is essential for normal growth and development and helps to maintain proper functioning of the heart and the nervous and digestive systems. Thiamine cannot be stored in the body; however, once absorbed, the vitamin is concentrated in muscle tissue.",59-43-8,1130.0,C12H17N4OS,265.11231,White powder.,248 dec°C,,5E+005 mg/L,"Oral; parenteral (intravenous, intramuscular).Absorbed mainly from duodenum, by both active and passive processes","It is thought that the mechanism of action of thiamine on endothelial cells is related to a reduction in intracellular protein glycation by redirecting the glycolytic flux. Thiamine is mainly the transport form of the vitamin, while the active forms are phosphorylated thiamine derivatives. There are five known natural thiamine phosphate derivatives: thiamine monophosphate (ThMP), thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), also sometimes called thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), thiamine triphosphate (ThTP), and the recently discovered adenosine thiamine triphosphate (AThTP), and adenosine thiamine diphosphate.

500,578,2234,2809,T3D2767,Mirtazapine,Mirtazapine is an antidepressant introduced by Organon International in 1996 used for the treatment of moderate to severe depression. Mirtazapine has a tetracyclic chemical structure and is classified as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA). It is the only tetracyclic antidepressant that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat depression.,61337-67-5,4205.0,C17H19N3,265.1579,White powder.,114-116°C,,Slight,"Oral.Rapid and complete, but, due to first-pass metabolism, absolute bioavailability is 50%.","Mirtazapine acts as an antagonist at central pre-synaptic alpha(2)-receptors, inhibiting negative feedback to the presynaptic nerve and causing an increase in NE release. Blockade of heteroreceptors, alpha(2)-receptors contained in serotenergic neurons, enhances the release of 5-HT, increasing the interactions between 5-HT and 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptors and contributing to the anxiolytic effects of mirtazapine. Mirtazapine also acts as a weak antagonist at 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptors and as a potent antagonist at 5-HT<sub>2</sub> (particularly subtypes 2A and 2C) and 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors. Blockade of these receptors may explain the lower incidence of adverse effects such as anxiety, insomnia, and nausea. Mirtazapine also exhibits significant antagonism at H1-receptors, resulting in sedation. Mirtazapine has no effects on the reuptake of either NE or 5-HT and has only minimal activity at dopaminergic and muscarinic receptors.","Mirtazapine is extensively metabolized by demethylation and hydroxylation followed by glucuronide conjugation. Cytochrome P450 2D6 and cytochrome P450 1A2 are involved in formation of the 8-hydroxy metabolite of mirtazapine, and cytochrome P450 3A4 is responsible for the formation of the N-desmethyl and N-oxide metabolites.

Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal should be administered. There is no experience with the use of forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion or exchange transfusion in the treatment of mirtazapine overdosage.

The designation vitamin B3 also includes the amide form, nicotinamide or niacinamide. Severe lack of niacin causes the deficiency disease pellagra, whereas a mild deficiency slows down the metabolism decreasing cold tolerance. The recommended daily allowance of niacin is 2-12 mg a day for children, 14 mg a day for women, 16 mg a day for men, and 18 mg a day for pregnant or breast-feeding women. It is found in various animal and plant tissues and has pellagra-curative, vasodilating, and antilipemic properties.

Niacin is the precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are vital cofactors for dozens of enzymes. The mechanism by which niacin exerts its lipid lowering effects is not entirely understood, but may involve several actions, including a decrease in esterification of hepatic triglycerides. Niacin treatment also decreases the serum levels of apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B), the major protein component of the VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) and LDL fractions.","Niacin is rapidly metabolized and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. The drug is converted to several metabolites, including nicotinuric acid (NUA), nicotinamide, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD).

This produces the niacin- or nicotinic acid-flush. The niacin-flush is thought to be mediated via the prostaglandin prostacyclin. Histamine may also play a role in the niacin-flush. Flushing is the adverse reaction first observed after intake of a large dose of nicotinic acid, and the most bothersome one. ",Supportive measures should be undertaken in the event of an overdose.

The narcotic antagonist naloxone will markedly reduce the degree of respiratory depression, and 0.4 to 2 mg should be administered promptly, preferably intravenously. If the desired degree of counteraction with improvement in respiratory functions is not obtained, naloxone should be repeated at 2- to 3-minute intervals. The duration of action of the antagonist may be brief. If no response is observed after 10 mg of naloxone have been administered, the diagnosis of propoxyphene toxicity should be questioned.

505,583,2297,2901,T3D2859,Midazolam,"A short-acting hypnotic-sedative drug with anxiolytic and amnestic properties. It is used in dentistry, cardiac surgery, endoscopic procedures, as preanesthetic medication, and as an adjunct to local anesthesia. The short duration and cardiorespiratory stability makes it useful in poor-risk, elderly, and cardiac patients.  It is water-soluble at pH less than 4 and lipid-soluble at physiological pH. [PubChem] Midazolam is a schedule IV drug in the United States.",59467-70-8,4192.0,C18H13ClFN3,325.0782,White powder.,159°C,,0.024 mg/mL,"Rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of the midazolam syrup in pediatric patients is about 36%. The absolute bioavailability, if given intramuscularly (IM), is greater than 90%. Cmax, IM = 90 ng/mL;Tmax, IM = 0.5 hours. Following IM administered, Cmax for midazolam and its 1-hydroxy metabolite were approxiately one-half of those achieved after intravenous injection. ","It is thought that the actions of benzodiazepines such as midazolam are mediated through the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain. Benzodiazepines increase the activity of GABA, thereby producing a calming effect, relaxing skeletal muscles, and inducing sleep. Benzodiazepines act as agonists at the benzodiazepine receptors, which form a component of the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor-chloride ionophore complex. Most anxiolytics appear to act through at least one component of this complex to enhance the inhibitory action of GABA.","Midazolam is primarily metabolized in the liver and gut by human cytochrome P450 IIIA4 (CYP3A4) to its pharmacologic active metabolite, (alpha)-hydroxymidazolam (also known as 1-hydroxy-midazolam), and 4-hydroxymidazolam (makes up 5% or less of the biotransformation products). 1-hydroxy-midazolam is at least as potent as the parent compound and may contributed to the overall activity of midazolam. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the affinities of 1- and 4-hydroxy-midazolam for the benzodiazepine receptor are approximately 20% and 7%, respectively, relative to midazolam. It also undergoes N-glucuronidation via UGT1A4. Route of Elimination: Midazolam is primarily metabolized in the liver and gut by human cytochrome P450 IIIA4 (CYP3A4) to its pharmacologic active metabolite, alpha-hydroxymidazolam, followed by glucuronidation of the alpha-hydroxyl metabolite which is present in unconjugated and conjugated forms in human plasma. The alpha- hydroxymidazolam glucuronide is then excreted in urine. No significant amount of parent drug or metabolites is extractable from urine before beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase deconjugation, indicating that the urinary metabolites are excreted mainly as conjugates. The amount of midazolam excreted unchanged in the urine when given intravenously is less than 0.5%. 45% to 57% of the dose was excreted in the urine as 1-hydroxymethyl midazolam conjugate. Half Life: Intravenous, healthy adults = 1.8 to 6.4 hours (mean of 3 hours)","LD50: 825 mg/kg (Oral, Rat)",,No indication of carcinogenicity to humans (not listed by IARC).,"Intravenous midazolam is indicated for procedural sedation (often in combination with an opioid, such as fentanyl), for pre-op sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation of ventilated patients in critical care units. Oral midazolam is indicated for the short term treatment of moderately severe insomnia in patients who did not adequately react to other hypnotics, and who have persistent trouble in falling asleep. [Wikipedia]",,"They cause slurred speech, disorientation and ""drunken"" behavior. They are physically and psychologically addictive.",,"Treatment of midazolam overdosage is the same as that followed for overdosage with other benzodiazepines. Respiration, pulse rate and blood pressure should be monitored and general supportive measures should be employed. Attention should be given to the maintenance of a patent airway and support of ventilation, including administration of oxygen. Should hypotension develop, treatment may include intravenous fluid therapy, repositioning, judicious use of vasopressors appropriate to the clinical situation, if indicated, and other appropriate counter-measures. Gastrointestinal decontamination with lavage and/or activated charcoal once the patient's airway is secure is also recommended. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of midazolam and may be used in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected.

It is closely related to piroxicam. In Europe it is marketed under the brand names Movalis, Melox, and Recoxa. In North America it is generally marketed under the brand name Mobic. In Latin America, the drug is marketed as Tenaron. [Wikipedia]",71125-38-7,5281106.0,C14H13N3O4S2,351.03475,White powder.,254 dec°C,,7.15 mg/L,Oral. Absolute bioavailability = 89%,"Anti-inflammatory effects of meloxicam are believed to be due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthetase (cylooxygenase), leading to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. As prostaglandins sensitize pain receptors, inhibition of their synthesis may be associated with the analgesic and antipyretic effects of meloxicam.","Meloxicam is almost completely metabolized into inactive metabolites by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isozymes. CYP2C9 is primarily responsible for metabolism of meloxicam while CYP3A4 plays a minor role. An intermediate metabolite, 5'-hydroxymethyl meloxicam, is further metabolized to 5'-carboxy meloxicam, the major metabolite. Peroxidase activity is thought to produce the two other inactive metabolites of meloxicam. Route of Elimination: Meloxicam is almost completely metabolized to four pharmacologically inactive metabolites. Meloxicam excretion is predominantly in the form of metabolites, and occurs to equal extents in the urine and feces. Only traces of the unchanged parent compound are excreted in the urine (0.2%) and feces (1.6%). The extent of the urinary excretion was confirmed for unlabeled multiple 7.5 mg doses: 0.5%, 6% and 13% of the dose were found in urine in the form of meloxicam, and the 5'-hydroxymethyl and 5'-carboxy metabolites, respectively.Half Life: 15-20 hours","LD50: 84 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (A308)LD50: 470 mg/kg (Oral, Mouse) (A308)LD50: 320 mg/kg (Oral, Rabbit) (A308)",,No indication of carcinogenicity to humans (not listed by IARC).,"Used to relieve the symptoms of arthritis, primary dysmenorrhea, fever; and as an analgesic, especially where there is an inflammatory component.",,"Can result in gastrointestinal toxicity and bleeding, tinnitus, headache, rash, very dark or black stool (sign of intestinal bleeding). [Wikipedia]",,"Patients should be managed with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdose. In cases of acute overdose, gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal is recommended. Gastric lavage performed more than one hour after overdose has little benefit in the treatment of overdose. Administration of activated charcoal is recommended for patients who present 1-2 hours after overdose. For substantial overdose or severely symptomatic patients, activated charcoal may be administered repeatedly. Accelerated removal of meloxicam by 4 gm oral doses of cholestyramine given three times a day was demonstrated in a clinical trial. Administration of cholestyramine may be useful following an overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.

508,587,2355,2976,T3D2934,Maprotiline,"Maprotiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant with similar pharmacological properties to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Similar to TCAs, maprotiline inhibits neuronal norepinephrine reuptake, possesses some anticholinergic activity, and does not affect monoamine oxidase activity. It differs from TCAs in that it does not appear to block serotonin reuptake.

","Maprotiline exerts its antidepressant action by inhibition of presynaptic uptake of catecholamines, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain. In single doses, the effect of maprotiline on the EEG revealed a rise in the alpha-wave density, a reduction of the alpha-wave frequency and an increase in the alpha-wave amplitude. However, as with other tricyclic antidepressants, maprotiline lowers the convulsive threshold. Maprotiline acts as an antagonist at central presynaptic &alpha;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and hetero-receptors, an action that is postulated to result in an increase in central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. Maprotiline is also a moderate peripheral &alpha;<sub>1</sub> adrenergic antagonist, which may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use. Maprotiline also inhibits the amine transporter, delaying the reuptake of noradrenaline and norepinephrine. Lastly, maprotiline is a strong inhibitor of the histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor, which explains its sedative actions.","Hepatic.

510,589,2357,2978,T3D2936,Aspirin,"Acetylsalicylic acid (acetosal) or aspirin is only found in individuals who have consumed this drug. Acetylsalicylic acid is a drug in the family of salicylates, often used as an analgesic (against minor pains and aches), antipyretic (against fever), and anti-inflammatory. It has also an anticoagulant effect and is used in long-term low-doses to prevent heart attacks and cancer. It was isolated from meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria, formerly classified as Spiraea ulmaria) by German researchers in 1839. While their extract was somewhat effective, it also caused digestive problems such as irritated stomach and diarrhoea, and even death when consumed in high doses. In 1853, a French chemist named Charles Frederic Gerhardt neutralized salicylic acid by buffering it with sodium (sodium salicylate) and acetyl chloride, creating acetosalicylic anhydride. Gerhardt's product worked, but he had no desire to market it and abandoned his discovery. In 1897, researcher Arthur Eichengrun and Felix Hoffmann, a research assistant at Friedrich Bayer & Co. in Germany, derivatized one of the hydroxyl functional groups in salicylic acid with an acetyl group (forming the acetyl ester), which greatly reduced the negative effects. This was the first synthetic drug, not a copy of something that existed in nature, and the start of the pharmaceuticals industry. The name 'aspirin' is composed of a- (from the acetyl group) -spir- (from the plant genus Spiraea) and -in (a common ending for drugs at the time). It has also been stated that the name originated by another means. As referring to AcetylSalicylic and 'pir' in reference to one of the scientists who was able to isolate it in crystalline form, Raffaele Piria. Finally 'in' due to the same reasons as stated above. Salicylic acid (which is a naturally occurring substance found in many plants) can be acetylated using acetic anhydride, yielding aspirin and acetic acid as a byproduct. It is a common experiment performed in organic chemistry labs, and generally tends to produce low yields due to the relative difficulty of its extraction from an aqueous state. The trick to getting the reaction to work is to acidify with phosphoric acid and heat the reagents under reflux with a boiling water bath for between 40 minutes and an hour. Aspirin acts as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase which results in the inhibition of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Aspirin also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p5).",50-78-2,2244.0,C9H8O4,180.04226,White powder.,135°C,140°C,4600 mg/L (at 25°C),"Absorption is generally rapid and complete following oral administration but may vary according to specific salicylate used, dosage form, and other factors such as tablet dissolution rate and gastric or intraluminal pH.","The analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects of acetylsalicylic acid are due to actions by both the acetyl and the salicylate portions of the intact molecule as well as by the active salicylate metabolite. Acetylsalicylic acid directly and irreversibly inhibits the activity of both types of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) to decrease the formation of precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes from arachidonic acid. This makes acetylsalicylic acid different from other NSAIDS (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen) which are reversible inhibitors. Salicylate may competitively inhibit prostaglandin formation. Acetylsalicylic acid's antirheumatic (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory) actions are a result of its analgesic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms; the therapeutic effects are not due to pituitary-adrenal stimulation. The platelet aggregation-inhibiting effect of acetylsalicylic acid specifically involves the compound's ability to act as an acetyl donor to cyclooxygenase; the nonacetylated salicylates have no clinically significant effect on platelet aggregation. Irreversible acetylation renders cyclooxygenase inactive, thereby preventing the formation of the aggregating agent thromboxane A2 in platelets. Since platelets lack the ability to synthesize new proteins, the effects persist for the life of the exposed platelets (7-10 days). Acetylsalicylic acid may also inhibit production of the platelet aggregation inhibitor, prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2), by blood vessel endothelial cells; however, inhibition prostacyclin production is not permanent as endothelial cells can produce more cyclooxygenase to replace the non-functional enzyme.","Acetylsalicylic acid is rapidly hydrolyzed primarily in the liver to salicylic acid, which is conjugated with glycine (forming salicyluric acid) and glucuronic acid and excreted largely in the urine.
Half Life: The plasma half-life is approximately 15 minutes; that for salicylate lengthens as the dose increases: doses of 300 to 650 mg have a half-life of 3.1 to 3.2 hours; with doses of 1 gram, the half-life is increased to 5 hours and with 2 grams it is increased to about 9 hours.","LD50: 250 mg/kg (Oral, Mouse) (A308)LD50: 1010 mg/kg (Oral, Rabbit) (A308)LD50: 200 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (A308)",,No indication of carcinogenicity to humans (not listed by IARC).,"For use in the temporary relief of various forms of pain, inflammation associated with various conditions (including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis), and is also used to reduce the risk of death and/or nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with a previous infarction or unstable angina pectoris.",,"Might increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding; large doses of salicylate, a metabolite of aspirin, have been proposed to cause tinnitus; Reye's syndrome, a severe illness characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver, can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illnesses or infections.

513,594,2384,3014,T3D2972,Melatonin,"Melatonin is a biogenic amine that is found in animals, plants and microbes. Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.",73-31-4,896.0,C13H16N2O2,232.12118,White powder.,117°C,,,The absorption and bioavailability of melatonin varies widely.,"Melatonin is a derivative of tryptophan. It binds to melatonin receptor type 1A, which then acts on adenylate cylcase and the inhibition of a cAMP signal transduction pathway. Melatonin not only inhibits adenylate cyclase, but it also activates phosphilpase C. This potentiates the release of arachidonate. By binding to melatonin receptors 1 and 2, the downstream signallling cascades have various effects in the body. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and melatonin receptor 2 (MT2). Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types.The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated for over two decades or since 1986. It is somewhat known, but still not fully understood. When melatonin receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes.
MT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SNC), hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.
The binding of melatonin to melatonin receptors activates a few signaling pathways. MT1 receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition causes a rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorilation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. MT1 receptors also activate phospholipase C (PLC), affect ion channels and regulate ion flux inside the cell. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP.[4] As well it hinders guanylyl cyclase and therefore the forming of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Binding to MT2 receptors probably affects PLC which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Activation of the receptor can lead to ion flux inside the cell.","Hepatically metabolized to at least 14 identified metabolites (identified in mouse urine): 6-hydroxymelatonin glucuronide, 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate, N-acetylserotonin glucuronide, N-acetylserotonin sulfate, 6-hydroxymelatonin, 2-oxomelatonin, 3-hydroxymelatonin, melatonin glucuronide, cyclic melatonin, cyclic N-acetylserotonin glucuronide, cyclic 6-hydroxymelatonin, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, di-hydroxymelatonin and its glucuronide conjugate. 6-Hydroxymelatonin glucuronide is the major metabolite found in mouse urine (65-88% of total melatonin metabolites in urine).

Evidence indicates that melatonin is likely effective for treating circadian rhythm sleep disorders in blind children and adults. It has received FDA orphan drug status as an oral medication for this use. A number of studies have shown that melatonin may be effective for treating sleep-wake cycle disturbances in children and adolescents with mental retardation, autism, and other central nervous system disorders. It appears to decrease the time to fall asleep in children with developmental disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, autism, and mental retardation. It may also improve secondary insomnia associated with various sleep-wake cycle disturbances. Other possible uses for which there is some evidence for include: benzodiazepine withdrawal, cluster headache, delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), primary insomnia, jet lag, nicotine withdrawal, preoperative anxiety and sedation, prostate cancer, solid tumors (when combined with IL-2 therapy in certain cancers), sunburn prevention (topical use), tardive dyskinesia, thrombocytopenia associated with cancer, chemotherapy and other disorders. ",,"Tolerance can develop, in which the person needs larger doses to achieve the desired effect; this can lead to overdose and death. Accidents or injury can also occur due to the side effects of loss of coordination, slowed reaction time, sleepiness and impaired judgment. Drugs in this category have a high potential for physical and psychological dependence. May cause a potentially dangerous rash that may develop into Stevens Johnson syndrome, an extremely rare but potentially fatal skin disease.","Loss of coordination, slowed reaction time, sleepiness and impaired judgment.

515,596,2388,3018,T3D2976,Diphenhydramine,"Diphenhydramine is a histamine H1 antagonist used as an antiemetic, antitussive, for dermatoses and pruritus, for hypersensitivity reactions, as a hypnotic, an antiparkinson, and as an ingredient in common cold preparations. It has some undesired antimuscarinic and sedative effects. -- Pubchem; Pseudoephedrine is a phenethylamine, and an isomer of ephedrine. Pseudoephedrine is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) of the (1S,2S)- diastereomer of ephedrine (which has 1R,2S- configuration). Other names are (+)-pseudoephedrine and D-pseudoephedrine (Reynolds, 1989). The enantiomer (-)-(1R,2R)-Pseudoephedrine has fewer side-effects, fewer central nervous system (CNS) stimulatory effects, does not reduce to d-methamphetamine, yet retains its efficacy as a decongestant. However, the patent holder for (-)-Pseudoephedrine (Pfizer/Warner-Lambert) has not yet sought or received government approval for its sale to the public.(US Patent 6,495,529); Treatment for urinary incontinence is an unlabeled use for these medications. Unlabeled use means doctors can use the medication to treat a condition other than that for which it was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These medications are approved by the FDA for the treatment of nasal congestion caused by colds or allergies. However it has also been successful in treating stress incontinence by increasing the pressure (tension) exerted by the muscles of the bladder neck and the urethra, which helps retain the urine within the bladder. Despite being one of the oldest antihistamines on the market, it is by and large the most effective antihistamine available, either by prescription or over-the-counter, and has been shown to exceed the effectiveness of even the latest prescription drugs. Consequently, it is frequently used when an allergic reaction requires fast, effective reversal of the (often dangerous) effects of a massive histamine release. However, it is not always the drug of choice for treating allergies. Like many other first generation antihistamines, is also a potent anticholinergic agent. This leads to profound drowsiness as a very common side-effect, along with the possibilities of motor impairment (ataxia), dry mouth and throat, flushed skin, rapid or irregular heartbeat (tachycardia), blurred vision at near point due to lack of accommodation (cycloplegia), abnormal sensitivity to bright light (photophobia), pupil dilatation, urinary retention, constipation, difficulty concentrating, short-term memory loss, visual disturbances, hallucinations, confusion, erectile dysfunction, and delirium. -- Wikipedia;.",58-73-1,3100.0,C17H21NO,255.16231,White powder.,161-162°C,150-165°C at 2.00E+00 mm Hg,3060 mg/L (at 37°C),Oral; topical ; parenteral(intramuscular or intravenous injection).

Benzocaine acts to desensitize the penis, and theoretically allows an erection to be maintained. [Wikipedia]",,Allergic reactions occur with ester local anaesthetics (like benzocaine) because of the PABA structure. Benzocaine also is a well-known cause of methemoglobinemia. [Wikipedia]. Methemoglobinemia has been reported with benzocaine in oral overdose.

Methemoglobinemia may be treated with methylene blue, 1-2 mg/kg I.V. infused over several minutes. Seizures commonly respond to diazepam, while hypotension responds to I.V. fluids and Trendelenburg positioning. Bradyarrhythmias (when the heart rate is <60) can be treated with I.V., I.M., or SubQ atropine 15 mcg/kg. With the development of metabolic acidosis, I.V. sodium bicarbonate 0.5-2 mEq/kg and ventilatory assistance should be instituted.

Peripheral tissue conversion may be the mechanism of the adverse effects of levodopa.

[PubChem]L-Dopa is the naturally occurring form of dihydroxyphenylalanine and the immediate precursor of dopamine. Unlike dopamine itself, L-Dopa can be taken orally and crosses the blood-brain barrier. It is rapidly taken up by dopaminergic neurons and converted to dopamine. In particular, it is metabolized to dopamine by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6) is a required cofactor for this decarboxylation, and may be administered along with levodopa, usually as pyridoxine.",59-92-7,6047.0,C9H11NO4,197.06881,White powder.,284-285°C,,5000 mg/L (at 20°C),Levodopa is rapidly absorbed from the proximal small intestine by the large neutral amino acid (LNAA) transport carrier system.,"Striatal dopamine levels in symptomatic Parkinson's disease are decreased by 60 to 80%, striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission may be enhanced by exogenous supplementation of dopamine through administration of dopamine's precursor, levodopa. A small percentage of each levodopa dose crosses the blood-brain barrier and is decarboxylated to dopamine. This newly formed dopamine then is available to stimulate dopaminergic receptors, thus compensating for the depleted supply of endogenous dopamine.","95% of an administered oral dose of levodopa is pre-systemically decarboxylated to dopamine by the L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) enzyme in the stomach, lumen of the intestine, kidney, and liver.

This may hasten the elimination of entacapone in particular, by decreasing its absorption/reabsorption from the GI tract.  Intravenous fluids should be administered judiciously and an adequate airway maintained. The adequacy of the respiratory, circulatory and renal systems should be carefully monitored and appropriate supportive measures employed. Electrocardiographic monitoring should be instituted and the patient carefully observed for the development of arrhythmias; if required, appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy should be given. The possibility that the patient may have taken other drugs, increasing the risk of drug interactions (especially catechol-structured drugs) should be taken into consideration. Hemodialysis or hemoperfusion is unlikely to reduce entacapone levels due to its high binding to plasma proteins. (L1712)",2009-07-21 20:28:42+00:00,2014-12-24 20:25:56+00:00,Levodopa,,C00355,"128230

Benzyl acetate occurs in jasmine, apple, cherry, guava fruit and peel, wine grape, white wine, tea, plum, cooked rice, Bourbon vanilla, naranjila fruit (Solanum quitoense), Chinese cabbage and quince. Benzyl acetate is a flavouring agent Benzyl acetate is an organic compound with the molecular formula C9H10O2. It is the ester formed by condensation of benzyl alcohol and acetic acid. It is one of many compounds that is attractive to males of various species of orchid bees, who apparently gather the chemical to synthesize pheromones; it is commonly used as bait to attract and collect these bees for study.Benzyl acetate belongs to the family of Benzyloxycarbonyls. These are organic compounds containing a carbonyl group substituted with a benzyloxyl group.",140-11-4,8785.0,C9H10O2,150.06808,Water-white liquid (T39).,-51.3°C,210°C (410°F),3.1 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L1223) ; inhalation (L1223) ; dermal (L1223) ; eye contact (L1223),"Benzyl acetate is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of OP exposure.","LD50: 2490 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L1223)

(L135)",It is used widely in perfumery and cosmetics for its aroma and in flavorings to impart apple and pear flavors (L1222).,,"Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Vomiting, drowiness, diarrhea, convulsions and burning sensation may result from ingestion or inhalation. Moreover, inhalation may cause laboured breathing and sore throat. Redness of the eyes, dry skin, depending of the contact surface (L1225).","If the compound has been ingested, rapid gastric lavage should be performed using 5% sodium bicarbonate. For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",2009-07-30 17:56:28+00:00,2014-12-24 20:26:00+00:00,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzyl_acetate,,C15513,,52051.0,CPD-103,,Benzyl acetate,,J0Z,152.0,True,CC(=O)OCC1=CC=CC=C1,C9H10O2,"InChI=1S/C9H10O2/c1-8(10)11-7-9-5-3-2-4-6-9/h2-6H,7H2,1H3",InChIKey=QUKGYYKBILRGFE-UHFFFAOYSA-N,150.1745,150.068079564,Exogenous,Liquid,1.96,HMDB31310,CHEMBL1233714,13850405.0,,,,"(acetoxymethyl)benzene

Ethyl acrylate is a flavouring ingredient Although there are some reports claiming that ethyl acrylate is a carcinogen, major respected bodies regard the evidence of human carcinogenicity as weak and/or inconsistent. The International Agency for Research on Cancer stated, Overall evaluation, Ethyl acrylate is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states, Human studies on occupational exposure to ethyl acrylate&hellip; have suggested a relationship between exposure to the chemical(s) and colorectal cancer, but the evidence is conflicting and inconclusive. In a study by the National Toxicology Program (NTP), increased incidences of squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas of the forestomach were observed in rats and mice exposed via gavage (experimentally placing the chemical in the stomach). However, the NTP recently determined that these data were not relevant to human carcinogenicity and removed ethyl acrylate from its list of carcinogens. (Occupational exposure generally involves exposure that occurs regularly, over an extended period of time). Ethyl acrylate is an organic compound primarily used in the preparation of various polymers. It is a clear liquid with an acrid penetrating odor. The human nose is capable of detecting this odor at a thousand times lower concentration then is considered harmful if continuously exposed for some period of time.",140-88-5,8821.0,C5H8O2,100.05243,Clear liquid (T21).,-71.2°C,99.4°C (210.9°F),15 mg/mL at 25°C,Inhalation (T21) ; oral (T21) ; dermal (T21) ; eye contact (T21). ,"Ethyl acrylate causes gastric lesions depending upon upon the rate of chemical delivery to stomach tissue as a result of interaction of the parent molecule or metabolites (other than hydrolysis products), with subcellular sites in stomach tissue (A2451).","Ethyl acrylate is hydrolized to acrylic acid in liver, kidney, and lung homogenates. It is suggested to bind to glutathione spontaneaoulsy and after catalysis by liver glutathione-S-transferase. The major metabolites of ethyl acrylate are mercapturic acids od ethyl acrylate and acrylic acid. Three metabolites were identified in a study: 3-hydroxypropionic acid and two mercapturic acids. N-Acetyl-S-(2-carboxyethyl)cysteine arises by glutathione conjugation of acrylic acid, while N-acetyl-S-(2-carboxyethyl)cysteine ethyl ester derives from the conjugation of intact ethyl acrylate.(A347, A635, A664, ).","LD50: 760-1020 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (T59)

It is a vicinal diketone (two C=O groups, side-by-side) with the molecular formula C4H6O2. Carrier of aroma of butter, vinegar, coffee, and other foods. Beer sometimes undergoes a diacetyl rest, which entails waiting two or three days after fermentation is complete, to allow the yeast to absorb the diacetyl it produced earlier in the fermentation cycle. The makers of some wines, such as chardonnay, deliberately promote the production of diacetyl because of the feel and flavors it imparts.",431-03-8,650.0,C4H6O2,86.03678,Yellow to green liquid (L1280).,-2.4°C,88°C,200 mg/mL at 15°C,Oral (L1280) ; inhalation (L1280) ; dermal (L1280) ; eye contact (L1280),"Diacetyl is a cholinesterase or acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.","Diacetyl  is reduced to 2,3-butanediol (A350).","LD50: 1580 mg/kg (Oral, Rat) (L1280)

(L135),"Carrier of aroma of butter, vinegar, coffee and other foods (A646).",,"Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.","Causes eye irritation, redness and pain. Causes moderate skin irritation. Harmful if swallowed.

For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses.

In the food industry acetic acid is used as an acidity regulator. The acetyl group, derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to the biochemistry of virtually all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A it is central to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. However, the concentration of free acetic acid in cells is kept at a low level to avoid disrupting the control of the pH of the cell contents. Acetic acid is produced and excreted by certain bacteria, notably the Acetobacter genus and Clostridium acetobutylicum.

Like cyanamide, it contains 66% nitrogen by mass and, if mixed with resins, has fire retardant properties due to its release of nitrogen gas when burned or charred, and has several other industrial uses. Melamine is also a metabolite of cyromazine, a pesticide. It is formed in the body of mammals who have ingested cyromazine. It has been reported that cyromazine can also be converted to melamine in plants. Melamine is described as Harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Chronic exposure may cause cancer or reproductive damage. Eye, skin and respiratory irritant. However, the short-term lethal dose is on a par with common table salt with an LD50 of more than 3 grams per kilogram of bodyweight.[15] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scientists explained that when melamine and cyanuric acid are absorbed into the bloodstream, they concentrate and interact in the urine-filled renal tubules, then crystallize and form large numbers of round, yellow crystals, which in turn block and damage the renal cells that line the tubes, causing the kidneys to malfunction.",108-78-1,7955.0,C3H6N6,126.06539,White powder.

Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in medicine, photography, and dyes. Iodine is required for the production of thyroid hormones, which are essential for normal brain development, and the fetus, newborn, and young child are particularly vulnerable to iodine deficiency. Physiologically, iodine exists as an ion in the body. The iodine requirement increases during pregnancy and recommended intakes are in the range of 220-250 microg/day. Monitoring iodine status during pregnancy is a challenge. New recommendations from World Health Organization suggest that a median urinary iodine concentration >250 microg/L and <500 microg/L indicates adequate iodine intake in pregnancy. Based on this range, it appears that many pregnant women in have inadequate intakes. Thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration in the newborn is a sensitive indicator of mild iodine deficiency in late pregnancy. The potential adverse effects of mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy are uncertain. Controlled trials of iodine supplementation in mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women suggest beneficial effects on maternal and newborn serum thyroglobulin and thyroid volume, but no effects on maternal and newborn total or free thyroid hormone concentrations. There are no long-term data on the effect of iodine supplementation on birth outcomes or infant development. New data from well-controlled studies indicate that iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient school-age children has clear benefits: it improves cognitive and motor function; it also increases concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3, and improves somatic growth.

This results in decreased iodination of thyroglobulin and inhibited production and release of T4 and T3, causing hypothyroidism. (L1844)","Iodine can enter the body following ingestion, inhalation, or dermal exposure. In the body, iodine and iodide accumulates in the thyroid gland, where it is used for producing the thyroid hormones T4 and T3. Iodide in the thyroid gland is incorporated into a protein, thyroglobulin, as covalent complexes with tyrosine residues. The iodination of thyroglobulin is catalyzed by the enzyme thyroid peroxidase. The iodination reactions occur at the follicular cell-lumen interface and consist of the oxidation of iodide to form a reactive intermediate, the formation of monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine residues in thyroglobulin, and the coupling of theiodinated tyrosine residues to form T4 (coupling of two diiodotyrosine residues) or T3 (coupling of a monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine residue) in thyroglobulin. The major pathways of metabolism of iodine that occur outside of the thyroid gland involve the catabolism of T4 and T3, and include deiodination reactions, ether bond cleavage of thyronine, oxidative deamination and decarboxylation of the side chain of thyronine, and conjugation of the phenolic hydroxyl group on thyronine with glucuronic acid and sulfate.

(A3101)","Citrinin produces proximal tubular necrosis, but only after transport into proximal tubular cells. It utilizes the organic anion transporter for entry into the cells, a transporter probably important physiologically for moving metabolic substrates into cells. Citrinin is also cytotoxic and increases formation of reactive oxygen species by stimulating the production of superoxide anion in the respiratory chain. It further potentiates this oxidative stress by modifying antioxidative enzymatic defences by inhibiting GSSG-reductase and transhydrogenase. Citrinin also alters mitochondrial function and permeability, decreasing Ca2+ accumulation in the matrix by inhibiting its influx and increasing its efflux. This is thought to induce apoptosis through the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, which is known to activate apoptosis-regulating caspases 3, 6, 7, and 9. Citrinin inhibits respiration by interfering with the NADH oxidase and NADH cytochrome c reductase involved with complex I of the respiratory chain. Mycotoxins are often able to enter the liver and kidney by human organic anion transporters (hOATs) and human organic cation transporters (hOCTs). They can also inhibit uptake of anions and cations by these transporters, interefering with the secretion of endogenous metabolites, drugs, and xenobiotics including themselves. This results in increased cellular accumulation of toxic compounds causing nephro- and hepatotoxicity. (A707, A2860, A2982, A3014)",The major urinary metabolite of CTN is dihydrocitrinone.

It is naturally derived from coconut and/or palm kernel oil. It usually consisting of a mixture of sodium alkyl sulfates, mainly the lauryl. SLS lowers surface tension of aqueous solutions and is used as fat emulsifier, wetting agent, and detergent in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and toothpastes. It is also used in creams and pastes to properly disperse the ingredients and as research tool in protein biochemistry. SLS also has some microbicidal activity. The molecule has a tail of 12 carbon atoms, attached to a sulfate group, giving the molecule the amphiphilic properties required of a detergent. SLS is a highly effective surfactant used in any task requiring the removal of oily stains and residues. As such the compound is found in high concentrations in industrial products including engine degreasers, floor cleaners, and car wash soaps. In household products, SLS is used in lower concentrations with toothpastes, shampoos, and shaving foams. It is an important component in bubble bath formulations for its thickening effect and its ability to create a lather. SLS may irritate the skin and eyes.

558,656,2694,3713,T3D3660,Glycolic acid,"Glycolic acid (or hydroxyacetic acid) is the smallest alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA). This colourless, odourless, and hygroscopic crystalline solid is highly soluble in water. Due to its excellent capability to penetrate skin, glycolic acid is often used in skin care products, most often as a chemical peel. It may reduce wrinkles, acne scarring, and hyperpigmentation and improve many other skin conditions, including actinic keratosis, hyperkeratosis, and seborrheic keratosis. Once applied, glycolic acid reacts with the upper layer of the epidermis, weakening the binding properties of the lipids that hold the dead skin cells together. This allows the outer skin to dissolve, revealing the underlying skin. It is thought that this is due to the reduction of calcium ion concentrations in the epidermis and the removal of calcium ions from cell adhesions, leading to desquamation. Glycolic acid is a known inhibitor of tyrosinase. This can suppress melanin formation and lead to a lightening of skin colour. Acute doses of glycolic acid on skin or eyes leads to local effects that are typical of a strong acid (e.g. dermal and eye irritation). Glycolate is a nephrotoxin if consumed orally. A nephrotoxin is a compound that causes damage to the kidney and kidney tissues. Glycolic acid's renal toxicity is due to its metabolism to oxalic acid. Glycolic and oxalic acid, along with excess lactic acid, are responsible for the anion gap metabolic acidosis. Oxalic acid readily precipitates with calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. Renal tissue injury is caused by widespread deposition of oxalate crystals and the toxic effects of glycolic acid. Glycolic acid does exhibit some inhalation toxicity and can cause respiratory, thymus, and liver damage if present in very high levels over long periods of time.",79-14-1,757.0,C2H4O3,,White powder.,75-80°C,,1000 mg/mL at 25°C,Oral (L1909) ; dermal (L1909),"Glycolic acid's toxicity is due to its metabolism to oxalic acid.

Oxalic acid readily precipitates with calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. Tissue injury is caused by widespread deposition of oxalate crystals and the toxic effects of glycolic acid. (A612, A613) ","The main path of the degradation of glycolic acid is to glyoxylic acid. This reaction is mediated by lactic dehydrogenase or glycolic acid oxidase. Once glyoxylic acid is formed, it is apparently degraded very rapidly to a variety of products, a few of which have been observed. Its breakdown to 2-hydroxy-3-oxoadipate it is thought, is mediated by thiamine pyrophosphate in the presence of magnesium ions. The formation of glycine involves pyridoxal phosphate and glyoxylate transaminase, whereas the formation of carbon dioxide and water via formic acid apparently involves coenzyme A (CoA) and flavin mononucleotides.

It may reduce wrinkles, acne scarring, hyperpigmentation and improve many other skin conditions, including actinic keratosis, hyperkeratosis, and seborrheic keratosis. Glycolic acid is also a useful intermediate for organic synthesis and finds employment in the textile industry as a dyeing and tanning agent, in food processing as a flavoring agent and as a preservative. Glycolic acid is often included into emulsion polymers, solvents and additives for ink and paint in order to improve flow properties and impart gloss. (L1909)",,"Glycolic acid metabolizes to oxalic acid, which reacts with calcium and forms calcium oxalate crystals in the kidney. This can cause kidney injury, leading to acute kidney failure. (L1023)
Chronically high levels of glycolic acid are associated with the inborn error of metabolism known as Type I primary hyperoxaluria. Oxalate stones in primary hyperoxaluria tend to be severe, resulting in relatively early kidney damage (before age 20), which impairs the excretion of oxalate leading to a further acceleration in accumulation of oxalate in the body. After the development of renal failure patients may develop oxalate deposits in the bones, joints and bone marrow. Severe cases may develop haematological problems such as anaemia and thrombocytopaenia. The deposition of oxalate in the body is sometimes called ""oxalosis"" to be distinguished from ""oxaluria"" which refers to oxalate in the urine.","Glycolic acid is a strong irritant. Accumulation of glycolic acid and its metabolite, oxalic acid, causes tachycardia, hypertension, hyperventilation, and metabolic acidosis. (L1023, L1909)","Chronic Exposure: In some patients with primary hyperoxaluria type 1, pyridoxine treatment (vitamin B6) may decrease oxalate excretion and prevent kidney stone formation.

These fatty acids were also shown to induce oxidative stress in the brain (A15456). Experiments suggest that OA and DA impair brain mitochondrial energy homeostasis that could underlie at least in part the neuropathology of MCADD. (A15457)","Capric acid (decanoic acid) is rapidly metabolized by the β-oxidative pathway, giving rise to C8- and C6-dicarboxylic acids (T29). The enzyme MCAD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) is responsible for the dehydrogenation step of fatty acids with chain lengths between 6 and 12 carbons as they undergo beta-oxidation in the mitochondria. Fatty acid beta-oxidation provides energy after the body has used up its stores of glucose and glycogen. This typically occurs during periods of extended fasting or illness when caloric intake is reduced, and energy needs are increased. Beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids produces two carbon units, acetyl-CoA and the reducing equivalents NADH and FADH2. NADH and FADH2 enter the electron transport chain and are used to make ATP. Acetyl-CoA enters the Krebs Cycle and is also used to make ATP via the electron transport chain and substrate level phosphorylation. When the supply of acetyl-CoA (coming from the beta-oxidation of fatty acids) exceeds the capacity of the Krebs Cycle to metabolize acetyl-CoA, the excess acetyl-CoA molecules are converted to ketone bodies (acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate) by HMG-CoA synthase in the liver. Ketone bodies can also be used for energy especially by the brain and heart; in fact they become the main sources of energy for those two organs after day three of starvation.

The major features of the disease include hypoglycemia, vomiting, lethargy and encephalopathy after fasting, infection or other metabolic stressors. (A15457)","MCADD presents in early childhood with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and liver dysfunction, often preceded by extended periods of fasting or an infection with vomiting.

563,668,3648,5032,T3D4973,Cobalt-60,"Cobalt-60, <sup>60</sup>Co, is a synthetic radioactive isotope of cobalt with a half-life of 5.2714 years. It is produced artificially by neutron activation of the isotope <sup>59</sup>Co. <sup>60</sup>Co decays by beta decay to the stable isotope nickel-60 (<sup>60</sup>Ni). Cobalt is a metallic element with the atomic number 27. It is found naturally in rocks, soil, water, plants, and animals. In small amounts cobalt is an essential element for life, as it is part of vitamin B12. However, excess exposure is known to exhibit toxic effects.

It produces oxygen radicals and may be oxidized to ionic cobalt, causing increased lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and inducing certain enzymes that lead to cell apoptosis. Cobalt has also been shown to block inorganic calcium channels, possibly impairing neurotransmission. Cobalt can also chelate lipoic acids, impairing oxidation of pyruvate or fatty acids. In addition, cobalt may inhibit DNA repair by interacting with zinc finger DNA repair proteins, and has also been shown to inhibit heme synthesis and glucose metabolism. Cobalt may activate specific helper T-lymphocyte cells and interact directly with immunologic proteins, such as antibodies (IgA and IgE) or Fc receptors, resulting in immunosensitization. Radioactive cobalt damages DNA, RNA, and lipids through ionizing events. (L29)","Cobalt is absorbed though the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. Since it is a component of the vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), it is distributed to most tissues of the body. It is transported in the blood, often bound to albumin, with the highest levels being found in the liver and kidney. Cobalt is excreted mainly in the urine and faeces.
